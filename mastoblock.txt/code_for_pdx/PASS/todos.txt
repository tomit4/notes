You have already started learning a bit of REACTJS in prep for this (and jobs...).

Look into the solidproject as it seems they are using this architecture to develop their application. The learning curve MAY be steep on this, but look at:

https://solidproject.org

They have some basic starting tutorials.

There appears to be very little about the solid project on youtube, but check out what you can to familiarize yoruself.

Flo has sent you onboarding documentation via Google Docs, you've already read over them but familiarize yourself again before the meeting at 7pm on Tuesday (will be emailed link).

Continue to familiarize yourself with the current code base as much as you can and see where it hooks up to solid.
