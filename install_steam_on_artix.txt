Enable the Arch Repositories.

sudo pacman -S artix-archlinux-support (copy and paste the repositories into the pacman.conf)

sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf

Uncomment the artix lib32 repositories.

Uncomment the arch multilib repositories.

Once you have edited the pacman.conf, enter the following command:

sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux

Then sync all your repositories:

sudo pacman -Syy

To be sure, go ahead and update the system again:

sudo pacman -Syu

You will need a web browser to use Chris Titus's guide on setting up gaming on Linux (you'll most likely just need this guide though).

Reset your ulimit:

To see your current ulimit:

ulimit -Hn

Now let's edit our limit:

sudo vim /etc/limits

Type in the following (username is your username):

username N524288

Write/Quite your text editor, and then edit the following file:

sudo vim /etc/security/limits.conf

Scroll to the end of the file and make a couple new lines under the <domain> section

username    soft    nofile    524288
username    hard    nofile    524288
@username    soft    nofile    524288
@username    hard    nofile    524288

Write/Quit the file, and now set the changes (log off or reboot).

Once you have rebooted (check your ulimit to see if it was set):

ulimit -Hn

This should now return 524288.

You can now enable esync into steam and lutris.

From here we now use Chris Titus's guide to install drivers.

https://www.christitus.com/ultimate-linux-gaming-guide/

Enter the following command to install the drivers:

sudo pacman -S lib32-mesa vulkan-radeon lib32-vulkan-radeon vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader -y

Once that has finished, you will then edit your etc environment:

sudo vim /etc/environment

And append this on a new line:

RADV_PERFTEST=aco

Write/Quit, and now install wine by entering the following command:

You will be given some split option repositories (always choose world, always choose multilib, and artix repositories if given that choice).

sudo pacman -S wine-staging giflib lib32-giflib libpng lib32-libpng libldap lib32-libldap gnutls lib32-gnutls mpg123 lib32-mpg123 openal lib32-openal v4l-utils lib32-v4l-utils libpulse lib32-libpulse libgpg-error lib32-libgpg-error alsa-plugins lib32-alsa-plugins alsa-lib lib32-alsa-lib libjpeg-turbo lib32-libjpeg-turbo sqlite lib32-sqlite libxcomposite lib32-libxcomposite libxinerama lib32-libgcrypt libgcrypt lib32-libxinerama ncurses lib32-ncurses opencl-icd-loader lib32-opencl-icd-loader libxslt lib32-libxslt libva lib32-libva gtk3 lib32-gtk3 gst-plugins-base-libs lib32-gst-plugins-base-libs vulkan-icd-loader lib32-vulkan-icd-loader lutris -y

Once finished, install steam:

sudo pacman -S steam

And start steam so that it can set up its configuration, either through the desktop, or simply enter the following command:

steam

Make sure not to install steam-native-runtime. To be sure it isn't installed, run the following command:

sudo pacman -R steam-native-runtime

Next install protonup using the following commands (you will need git for this):

git clone https://github.com/AUNaseef/protonup

cd protonup

python3 setup.py install --user

Next we are going to edit our .bash_profile, cd to your home directory and enter the following command to see all hidden files:

ls -a

Once you have located your .bash_profile, enter the following command:

sudo vim .bash_profile

On a new line enter the following (before the [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] line):

if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi

Write/Quit out of that file.

Restart terminal, or simply enter:

source .bash_profile

From the home directory make a new directory:

mkdir .steam/root/compatibilitytools.d

And then enter the following command:

protonup -d ".steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/"

And then enter the following command, and enter Y for yes when prompted:

protonup

And that finishes longview3k's tutorial, I also needed to install lib32-nvidia-utils for my NVIDIA card.

sudo pacman -S lib32-nvidia-utils

TIP:  You can enable Proton under Steam menu's Settings/Steam_Play section.

ADDENDUM/NOTE: I believe that this installation process at some point installed lib32-systemd, which while allowing steam to work, conflicted with the lib32-eudev and lib32-elogind packages.  Simply remove lib32-systemd and install these packages.

sudo pacman -Rd --nodeps lib32-systemd

The caveat is that steam will still look for libsystemd.so.0 in the /usr/lib32/ directory. Simpy install the libelongd package and create a soft link to the libsystemd.so.0 file ( if it already exists delete it).

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libelogind.so /usr/lib32/libsystemd.so.0
