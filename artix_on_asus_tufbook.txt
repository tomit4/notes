Use the live installation iso usb stick to boot into the live environment.

Mount the nvme01p2 (your installed home partition) to /mnt (must be root)
su
mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt

Chroot into it:
artix-chroot /mnt

Then we need to make some adjustments

nano /etc/default/grub
Change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to "nvme_load=YES"
And update it:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Then:
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
Change the Modules from an empty string to "vmd"
And also the line that has autodetect and block in it. Make sure that block is listed before autodetect in the line up.
And update it:
mkinitcpio -P

And that's it, reboot, remove your installation media, and you're good.
