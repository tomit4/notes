This is just some notes on how to convert a .txt file to a .pdf file from the command line.
Eventually consider how to put this into a bash script, as it creates a series of unnecessary files in the conversion process that could easily be rmoved by a simple bash script.

You'll need the enscript and ghostscript packages:

doas pacman -S enscript ghostscript

Simple Conversion of txt File to pdf File

enscript -p output.ps input.txt

ps2pdf output.ps output.pdf
