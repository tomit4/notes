# BYPASSING REGISTRATION AND LOGIN ON NEW DEVICE

Plug in new Kobo Device via USB to Linux Computer.

Mount the device:

doas mount /dev/sda /mnt/media/kobo

Navigate to the device folder and then enter the .kobo subdirectory:

cd .kobo

As root, open up the KoboReader.sqlite database:

sqlite3 KoboReader.sqlite

And then enter the following SQL command:

INSERT INTO user(UserId,UserKey) VALUES('1','');

Then Quit:

.q

Exit Root:

exit

And then navigate to your home directory and unmount the kobo:

doas umount /mnt/media/kobo

Now you should be able to access the Kobo interface without having to register your Kobo.

## Converting to Kepub format

Many of the books you'll find around are in .epub format, but some books have a hard time loading 
and/or freeze the kobo device in this format. Best practice is to convert it to kobo's proprietary format .kepub.
This can be accomplished using the [calibre software](https://calibre-ebook.com/download), which you can download 
from your Artix's repos in the extra mirrors. You'll need to also get some plugins to automatically convert it.
See [this github repo](https://github.com/jgoguen/calibre-kobo-driver) on how to install plugins. Once done, ALWAYS
mount your kobo device using calibre and copy the .epub files to the kobo directly, this will automatically convert 
it if you use the KoboTouchExtended plugin specifically (though all kobo and kepub plugins are encouraged to be installed.)
