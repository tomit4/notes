# After having had some difficulties installing mariaDB for Manjaro Linux, I though it best to document the basic installation process, as well as how I solved the issue.

# MariaDB is a free and open source version of the original MySQL.  It is a robust SQL database that is easily run from the command line interface.

# Installation of mariaDB on Manjaro Linux starts off very much like most installations do with Arch based distrobutions, with the pacman package manager:

sudo pacman -S mariadb

# After installation is complete, enter:

sudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql

# This will initialize our first mariadb database, note the location of the --datadir.  This is where our problem occurred.

# After initializing our database, start the server and db.  The enable command will start mariadb on system startup.

sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb (this way we don't have to systemctl start mariadb every time we want to access our database)

# Finally you'll want to secure your database:

sudo mysql_secure_installation

# You will be prompted with a series of questions about how secure you wish to make your database.

# You may also wish to install and configure MySQL Workbench(not really all that good, install dbeaver instead, dbeaver requires java):

sudo pacman -S mysql-workbench

# The issue that I ran into during installation is that the permissions of /var/lib/mysql were not allowed for anyone, only access to the folder was allowed for mysql user.  To change this, I ran this command:

sudo chown -R mysql: /var/lib/mysql

# the -R flag recursively changed ownership permissions throughout the entire /var/lib/mysql directory, whereas the user mysql only had permissions the directory itself.
