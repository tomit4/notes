Decentraleyes (Chromium)
=============

A [web browser extension](https://decentraleyes.org) that emulates Content Delivery Networks to improve your online privacy. It intercepts traffic, finds supported resources locally, and injects them into the environment. All of this happens automatically, so no prior configuration is required. Feel free to use the following [testing utility](https://decentraleyes.org/test/) to find out if you are properly protected. For more information, please read this [basic introduction](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wikis/Simple-Introduction).

> **Note:** Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.
