Just an idea I&amp;#39;ve had: what if the whole idea of Jesus debating (in the canonical Gospels) with the Pharisees was made up just to give Jesus a human antagonist against whom to juxtapose his ideas? Without the Pharisees, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have had as many opportunities to get his ideas across, at least as dramatically. If you read the Gospel of Thomas (which is not in the Bible) you get just a list of sayings which are very similar (from my reading so far) to ones in the Biblical Gospels. So maybe these sayings had to be inserted into a narrative‚Äîthe Passion of Christ‚Äî, or at least inserted into a narrative with the Pharisees, to bring these teachings to life as more than just aphorisms?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t say this to just &amp;#39;gotcha!&amp;#39; Christianity‚ÄîI&amp;#39;m not interested in doing that, so please refrain from such low-effort comments. I just think maybe that&amp;#39;s their purpose in the (Bible version of) the story. The Pharisees do seem like irritatingly one-sided characters whose only purpose is to give Jesus an opportunity to preach, put simply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(There are non-biblical Gospels too, hence all the parentheses.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ReturnOfTheKing123&quot;&gt; /u/ReturnOfTheKing123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10jj4rt/maybe_the_pharisees_are_just_a_rhetorical_device/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10jj4rt/maybe_the_pharisees_are_just_a_rhetorical_device/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10jj4rt</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10jj4rt/maybe_the_pharisees_are_just_a_rhetorical_device/" /><updated>2023-01-23T18:10:46+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-23T18:10:46+00:00</published><title>Maybe the Pharisees are just a rhetorical device to give Jesus a dramatic opportunity to convey some lesson?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/mrlemandstraw</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/mrlemandstraw</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ik this is an agnostic Reddit community I&amp;#39;m posting this on but is it just me or.. do you go &amp;quot;there is a god&amp;quot; and later go &amp;quot;there isn&amp;#39;t a god&amp;quot; basically, constantly keep switching from Christian/(whatever your old religion was) to Atheist.

Jesus was a humble person. I get they gotta keep the lights on, and pay their priests and whatever, but people like Joel Osteen absolutely disgust me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The corruption within the Catholic Church also disgusts me. Between the ongoing priests assaulting minors, to all of the historical/biblical information that is being kept secret at the Vatican that‚Äôs off limits to the public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christianity is also the ONLY religion to actively try to convert people.

BOOM. Christianity would either crumble. Either they would outright ignore the fact that aliens exist, and/or compare an alien invasion to when the Egyptians held the Jews captive and Moses came to set them free. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure that I can actually believe in something greater than myself unless that something greater is aliens. Even at that, I wouldn‚Äôt worship aliens as Gods because they would just be smarter versions of us.

Aliens? (Serious)</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/zahzensoldier</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/zahzensoldier</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got into a bit of debate with my brother (we are both atheist) and I wonder if my frustration with religion broadly might be causing me to be short sighted. I don&amp;#39;t quite know how to get into it but I will try my best to highlight the bulk of the debate and what sparked it. I have a feeling there will be a fair amount of agreement with myself but I am really trying to have a broader discussion about the idea of being subject to beliefs of a religion you don&amp;#39;t hold and if it could reasonable be considered bigoted or prejudiced (ie Islamaphobic). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has recently been news about Hamline University not rehiring (or potentially firing) an adjunct art history professor because they displayed an old painting of Mohammed (more details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html&lt;/a&gt;). We are broadly in agreement that the professor shouldn&amp;#39;t have been fired and we both like how CAIR (national) handled the situation vs CAIR-MN which said what the professor did was Islamophobic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our debate started because even though I liked CAIR&amp;#39;s statement on the matter, one part of their statement I wasn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of was this idea that if you display an image of Mohamed outside of an academic context, that is Islamophobic. I disagree that simply displaying an image of Mohamed is automatically Islamophobic while my brother held that anyone who isn&amp;#39;t apart of Islam displaying an image probably has Islamophobic intentions. I understand we are arguing different things but it sparks a bigger discussion, I think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My problem with viewing it this way is it feels like he is arguing that we (non Muslim people) should be subject to the rules of Islam because we are being disrespectful and trying to attack the religion when we display an image of Mohamed. I really disagree with this concept because I feel like any religion could use it to push things on society. For example, we live in a Christian majority country (USA) and I feel like Christians essentially make the argument that gay people shouldn&amp;#39;t get married because it somehow offends or ruins their Christianity. I asked how it is different and he seemed to imply its different because gay people exist outside of Christianity where as Mohamed is a product of Islam. I really don&amp;#39;t like his answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I argued with him, how far do we go with this? I don&amp;#39;t feel like he is holding a consistent principled position but I do agree with the fact that a non-Muslim publicly displaying an image of Mohamed is probably doing it to cause harm but I still don&amp;#39;t know if we should knee-jerk react and call it Islamophobic. Does this make protesting a Church by hanging a cross upside down anti-Christian?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a suspicious my brother might not be consistent if I were to bring Christian examples of this to the table but I admittedly couldn&amp;#39;t think of any that are quite as comparable to Mohamed and images. I guess, I just feel like he&amp;#39;s paying way more deference to Islam than Christianity, which is one issue but I also feel like if you take his argument to the farther logical conclusion, this would mean enforcing restrictions or penalties (calling someone Islamophobic is going after their livelihood imo) on people because it disrespect a religion beliefs (beliefs you don&amp;#39;t follow).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I do recognize that legitimate bigots would use displaying pictures of Mohamed as a way to rile up Muslims and try to hurt them. But I don&amp;#39;t think displaying an image of Mohamed in it self is an immoral act. Showing a picture in of it self, it not immoral or bad. Granted, context always matter but still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to be a good neighbor to my Muslim friends and I&amp;#39;d personally never force the issue of trying to draw Mohamed but if I had some type of artistic calling that made me feel like I needed to paint a picture, I don&amp;#39;t think I should be automatically labeled a bigot or anti-muslim if I happen to call that a painting of Mohammed. I am still having a hard time synthetizing my thoughts which is why I am here. I do plan on eventually reaching out to muslims and christians as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/zahzensoldier&quot;&gt; /u/zahzensoldier &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10irkfr/debate_with_brother_being_subject_to_beliefs_you/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10irkfr/debate_with_brother_being_subject_to_beliefs_you/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10irkfr</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10irkfr/debate_with_brother_being_subject_to_beliefs_you/" /><updated>2023-01-22T19:15:23+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-22T19:15:23+00:00</published><title>Debate with Brother: Being subject to beliefs you don't hold</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ReturnOfTheKing123</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ReturnOfTheKing123</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually talk a lot about how they don&amp;#39;t like the god of the Old Testament, YHWH. Well, I don&amp;#39;t think I like Jesus. I&amp;#39;ve read the Sermon on the Mount and various other passages (in context) and parables, and I see some recurring themes. Now I am impressed at his ethical teachings. They seem surprisingly coherent. They are surprisingly and perhaps positively challenging. I&amp;#39;m not fond of his anti-flesh, world-hating (like the Gnostics); I personally despise asceticism. That aside, I can see how his teachings feed into the whole &lt;em&gt;Love thy God&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Love thy neighbour&lt;/em&gt; commandments, just as he says. However he comes across as being really angry and quite forceful with his ministry. He does not at all seem like a mystical person; in fact, he&amp;#39;s only mystical in how dedicated he seems to his cause: like the perfect zealot. The fact that I&amp;#39;m half-worried about burning in hell for telling you this should tell you a lot about his character! If you have to resort to threats of hell or armies of angels to make your point, are you truly enlightened? Do gurus usually behave like this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, Jesus says give your clothes to the poor, accept martyrdom, etc. if you wish to be perfect. What is the point of being a human being if our lives should be thrown away thus?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further, I cannot follow the first of his &amp;#39;greatest&amp;#39; commandments: love God more than anything else. Now my own personal idea of God is pantheistic-panentheistic, but if we go with the Biblical idea of God, for sure I cannot love Him more than my own Family who have been with me my whole life and are more apparent to me than any god.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what reaaally gripes me is how Jesus talks to the Canaanite woman who asks him for help. He dismisses her, saying he is busy tending to the tribe of Israel. He goes go on to calling his kind, the Jews, &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;, and her kind (my kind!) &lt;em&gt;dogs&lt;/em&gt;. Only when she accepts this insult does he accept her. Says how great is her faith! Or her desperation for help. Or her simplicity of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I ask you: should a divine being behave like this? Do you expect God Incarnate to be so angry and petty with the Pharisees, to be constantly resorting to threats of hell, and so rude to this woman just because she is not a Jew? You might say it is because she does not follow God, but how could she? God chose the Jews (conveniently), we are told.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, this is not the Jesus I was told about as a child. So, not only do I not like the God of Abraham, I don&amp;#39;t like Abraham and most of the Biblical characters that I&amp;#39;ve heard of (that&amp;#39;s another topic), and now I possibly don&amp;#39;t like Jesus either. The irony is my own spirituality has been quite influenced by Christian theologians, haha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahh. Life. It&amp;#39;s well-written, I&amp;#39;ll give you that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, blasphemy against Christ is forgivable apparently. Do I have to apologise first? O shit. O well. My mind remains open, but I don&amp;#39;t like this guy&amp;#39;s tone. What&amp;#39;s all this hell stuff about? I think even the Catechism tried to explain it away as being distance from God: heaven is closeness to God, hell is distance from Him. Hmm. Guess that medieval art&amp;#39;s a lie then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think my path lies elsewhere. A religion that has to threaten people so much does not seem like a religion for me. And a religion that thinks me lesser because I am not a Jew, well sod that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ReturnOfTheKing123&quot;&gt; /u/ReturnOfTheKing123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10i4zwe/i_dont_think_i_like_jesus/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10i4zwe/i_dont_think_i_like_jesus/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10i4zwe</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10i4zwe/i_dont_think_i_like_jesus/" /><updated>2023-01-21T23:31:46+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-21T23:31:46+00:00</published><title>I don't think I like Jesus</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/happysadboy_w</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/happysadboy_w</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been trying to wrap my head around it but I just can‚Äôt figure it out.

In my mind there are 3 main reasons why people choose to subscribe to specific religions rather than theism in general:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They were indoctrinated from a young age and it&amp;#39;s not something they would otherwise believe.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The possibility of eternal nothingness after death terrifies them.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They don&amp;#39;t want to accept that their loved ones aren&amp;#39;t waiting for them in paradise and they&amp;#39;ll never see them again.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Anomalous-33&quot;&gt; /u/Anomalous-33 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hl8gu/why_i_am_agnostic/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hl8gu/why_i_am_agnostic/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10hl8gu</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hl8gu/why_i_am_agnostic/" /><updated>2023-01-21T07:02:09+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-21T07:02:09+00:00</published><title>Why I Am Agnostic</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Shingyo2</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Shingyo2</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So recently I have gotten interested in the possible biology of god/allah/Zeus(whatever name you choose) one of the first theories I have is about how god would possibly be able to read our minds(atleast from our current understanding because god also has temporal abilities and I am not opening that can of worms) so I remember that our brains apparently work by sending small electronic signals to each other at an incredibly fast speed and afterwards I remembered that some animals like the platypus have electroreception so that got me curious is it likely that the reason a godlike entity is able to read our minds because of an advanced version of electroreception?

They have values&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;relgious person&lt;/strong&gt; believes in a relgiion. A &lt;strong&gt;relgiion&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of things they &lt;strong&gt;care&lt;/strong&gt; about&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a person collects things on a pinterest. These are the things they care about. A collection would also be a kind of relgiion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;groups within groups&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;indian&lt;/strong&gt; is a group of people, &lt;strong&gt;russian&lt;/strong&gt; is a group, etc &lt;strong&gt;jewish&lt;/strong&gt; is a groups&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;culture&lt;/strong&gt; is any &lt;strong&gt;group&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;cares&lt;/strong&gt; about things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A relgiion is a &lt;strong&gt;group&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;cares&lt;/strong&gt; about things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A relgiion is a &lt;strong&gt;culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans cares about different things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some humans care about science, but they dont care about &lt;strong&gt;spirtiual&lt;/strong&gt; things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These people that care about care about science, but not &lt;strong&gt;spirtiual&lt;/strong&gt; things would also be reglious people. They have a &lt;strong&gt;relgion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there and what is the difference between a Culture and a Relgion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference between a &lt;strong&gt;relgious culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And a &lt;strong&gt;culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is that &lt;strong&gt;relgious cultures&lt;/strong&gt; -- are specifcially -- about people that care about &lt;strong&gt;spirtiual&lt;/strong&gt; things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means people that care about care about science, - but not &lt;strong&gt;spirtiual&lt;/strong&gt; things would NOT be reglious people. They have a &lt;strong&gt;CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A non religious person that doesnt care about spirtiual things may have a label or name or may not, depends on the person. Relgiions always has names&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;spritiual&lt;/strong&gt; person who says that they dont have a relgiion is, to me, crazy. The most that could be said about that is that they have &lt;strong&gt;no groups&lt;/strong&gt;. The practical case would be that they just die off and along with it their &lt;strong&gt;personal cultture&lt;/strong&gt; - unless they write a book or w/e that people would consume - and possibly care about&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reglious people/groups ALSO have a CULTURE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That culture is call a relgion &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And we know what a relgion is. See above&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you know what &lt;strong&gt;relgious people&lt;/strong&gt; are. They are humans that &lt;strong&gt;cares&lt;/strong&gt; about things. They have values. Specifcially Spiritiual values&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about someone that labels themselves a religion but does not care&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, obviousy they are not a relgoius person. A relgoius person is.. See above &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what have we learned so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;A culture is ANY group of people that Cares about the same/similiar things&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A relgion is a Culture/group&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A relgion is Specifically a Culture that cares about Spirtiual things&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of a group/culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;group/culture&lt;/strong&gt; call &amp;#39;Mennonite&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again you already know that groups have mutiple groups within each group. This could go 10 levels down/up, or 100 levels/ Think about 1000 levels/or layers of groups. Not always hierarchical groups. Not black and white groups. Sometimes even nearly parallal groups/cultures. Your &lt;strong&gt;brain&lt;/strong&gt; can handle it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Youtube says that these &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39; cares about &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt;. Work is a &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt;. Things that people care about are call &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amish and Mennonites are &lt;strong&gt;basically&lt;/strong&gt; the same, just like they are with every other &lt;strong&gt;reglious groups/cultures&lt;/strong&gt;. There are differences&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are different relgious groups/cultures of &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be able to coommunicate in an easy and simple way, we&amp;#39;ll call these groups &amp;#39;group 1&amp;#39; &amp;#39;group 2&amp;#39; and so on and so forth etc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group 1 is the most &amp;#39;conversative&amp;#39; of all the groups. Group 1 cares about &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt;. They get to heaven or w/e they believe based on their &lt;strong&gt;works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They dont read the bible or anything weekly or anything like that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They dont go to church weekly or do anything that would normally (based on current cultures) qualify as &amp;#39;relgious&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They base their life around a set of rules that they follow extremley strictly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Group 1 of &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39; likely cares/values other things but &lt;strong&gt;works&lt;/strong&gt; is said to be #1 or basically somewhere at the very top&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since their lives are based primarly or mainly on rules, they would not be counted as a reglion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Group 1 of &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39; are not a &lt;strong&gt;relgious group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Group 1 of &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39; are a culture that are based around those &lt;strong&gt;cares&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So again, Group 1 of &amp;#39;Mennonites&amp;#39; are Not a relgious group really compared to the real reglious groups&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But you need to talk to humans within Group 1 (likely extensively enough) to really know&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or you just need to talk to someone within group 1 that really knows themselves very well. THen you&amp;#39;ll be able to get the answers within less than a min or so&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Group 1 is a VERY closed off group so youtube says. So you&amp;#39;re unlikely to be able to talk to Group 1. This seems to be the case with many groups (that are historically spirtual)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there seems to be a video in the youtube history timeline of group 1 but havent watched it yet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is a relgion?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Read other things so you can understand&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;person&lt;/strong&gt; who is &lt;strong&gt;agnostic&lt;/strong&gt; is a person that &lt;strong&gt;has not decided&lt;/strong&gt; on if they would &lt;strong&gt;care about&lt;/strong&gt; or believe &lt;strong&gt;spirtiual&lt;/strong&gt; things or not&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They dont know but they may still have values, but not spirtiual values&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/NarrowThought3141&quot;&gt; /u/NarrowThought3141 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hlk83/a_relgiion_is_a_culture/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hlk83/a_relgiion_is_a_culture/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10hlk83</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10hlk83/a_relgiion_is_a_culture/" /><updated>2023-01-21T07:23:27+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-21T07:23:27+00:00</published><title>A relgiion is a culture</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Valuable_Mirror2527</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Valuable_Mirror2527</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;so i believe there is a god, a god out there somewhere, but for some reason, I can&amp;#39;t come to terms with accepting my own religion Christianity.

Many ancient societies believed in multiple deities, spirits or gods that controlled different aspects of nature and human life. These beliefs were used to explain natural phenomena and to provide a sense of purpose and order in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to recognize that our understanding of the world has changed significantly since ancient times, and that many of these beliefs have been proven to be false or inaccurate by scientific research. Today, we have a much greater understanding of the natural world and the laws that govern it, which allows us to make more informed decisions about sustainability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not possible to confirm if spirits or gods exist or have any influence in our dimension, as it goes beyond science, but it is also not necessary to consider them in our daily life, unless they are part of personal belief and practices. Our focus should be on understanding the challenges of sustainability and working together to find solutions that balance economic, social and environmental concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/DieSystem&quot;&gt; /u/DieSystem &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10eqqmm/understanding_the_will_of_gods_is_not_important/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10eqqmm/understanding_the_will_of_gods_is_not_important/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10eqqmm</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10eqqmm/understanding_the_will_of_gods_is_not_important/" /><updated>2023-01-17T23:10:51+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-17T23:10:51+00:00</published><title>Understanding the will of gods is not important in our daily lives, according to ChatGPT.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/dontpmmetoes</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/dontpmmetoes</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;over 27 million people are being trafficked as of now. 2% of the world‚Äôs population is homeless. food insecurity effects 10% of people. over 400,000 people die of murder each year. more than 250,000 cases of rape or attempted rape are recorded by police each year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;these statistics may be off, as i only did a quick google search for each example. no matter the exact numbers, though, there is certainly too much suffering to logically view god as good‚Ä¶ if it even exists. i hope there is none, because if there is, i‚Äôd consider it to be a devil. a devil in charge of the universe is a horrifying thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/dontpmmetoes&quot;&gt; /u/dontpmmetoes &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10e2t4k/the_idea_of_god_being_good_is_a_privileged_mindset/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10e2t4k/the_idea_of_god_being_good_is_a_privileged_mindset/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10e2t4k</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/10e2t4k/the_idea_of_god_being_good_is_a_privileged_mindset/" /><updated>2023-01-17T04:29:29+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-17T04:29:29+00:00</published><title>the idea of god being good is a privileged mindset</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/sl1317</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/sl1317</uri></author><category term="agnostic" label="r/agnostic"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anybody here ever wish that they could fully believe in a God?

I believe there&amp;#39;s a possibility of life after death. A new world, a spiritual realm, a paradise, reincarnation.. etc. But I tend to lean more towards there being nothing after death and it&amp;#39;s been hard on me lately. I know we can never be sure until it happens. Until we actually die.. but I still can&amp;#39;t help but think about it. And sometimes I wish I could believe in the same higher power like certain friends and family members do. The peace you must feel believing that God promises you life after death has to be amazing. To not worry or be scared. Sometimes I wish that I could be like my JW family members. Or other Christian friends. Even if it winds up not being true. I still had that reassurance before dying. I tend to compare death to sleep and pre-existence. I don&amp;#39;t remember any dreams so its like I have none at all.. and I personally don&amp;#39;t remember the process of actually shutting down and falling asleep. I lay in the dark with my eyes closed.. exhausted.. and then all of a sudden I&amp;#39;m waking up the next day. So I would like to assume that&amp;#39;s what its like. Or like when we&amp;#39;re created. Before we&amp;#39;re born, we&amp;#39;re forming.. and NONE of us remember being tiny clumps of cells developing into a human...we had no real consciousness.. so why would we after death?

He thinks he has to try and save me and ‚Äúplant a seed‚Äù in my brain about religion constantly. I dont debatr with them and I respect their views but it bothers me so much that he‚Äôs always trying to change me. He sends me religious stuff like stories about people who converted to christianity and I mostly ignore them or try to respond in a nice/neutral way. It makes me so anxious because I never know how im supposed to respond or if my responses are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. I dont want to come across as mean but its very bothersome and gives me a lot of anxiety. I barely visit them and every time I do religion is a really big subject. He didnt used to be like this until fairly recently and I feel like the black sheep.
