Planning and pointing generally sucks. Tickets are often missing data. Mocks are not always accurate. Systems aren’t always working or ready when we’re ready. This is frontend work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At all my previous jobs, it was made very clear that points don’t really matter. It wouldn’t affect how we’re perceived or judged on performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently not here. Completed points per sprint are averaged out and used as a metric in performance reviews. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At my other jobs, points were simply days. How many days would it take to complete this ticket? Great. 10 days in a sprint, subtract two days for meetings and you’re expected to complete 8 points per sprint. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s very straightforward. Maybe it doesn’t follow whatever Agile methodology we’re supposed to be using but you know what? That’s a very clear way to estimate something in my opinion. You may disagree. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I prefer points as days of work. After all, we’re measuring against a unit of time: a two week sprint. It just makes sense to estimate that way in my mind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can understand both sides but when it comes down to my performance review relying on these metrics, how is a difficulty point system measured over a unit of time better than a time-based point system measured over a unit of time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time seems like a basic measurement to me. Difficulty is entirely subjective! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure new teammates or juniors won’t ramp up to the speed expected but they’re always accommodated in both systems so I don’t see that as an argument for one or the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/j3wxx&quot;&gt; /u/j3wxx &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10n7ya0/pips_points_and_performance_reviews/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10n7ya0/pips_points_and_performance_reviews/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10n7ya0</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10n7ya0/pips_points_and_performance_reviews/" /><updated>2023-01-28T06:11:41+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-28T06:11:41+00:00</published><title>PIPs, Points, and Performance Reviews</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/WorstUsernameChoice</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/WorstUsernameChoice</uri></author><category term="cscareerquestions" label="r/cscareerquestions"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I work in a customer support job where I&amp;#39;m WFH and make about $64,000/year before tax and such. It is definitely above the average as far as customer support pay goes and it&amp;#39;s not a terrible salary by any means as well as WFH being great, but A) it&amp;#39;s in California (so they were actually legally obligated to pay me that much at a minimum- but the high cost of living offsets it) and B) it&amp;#39;s customer support so it&amp;#39;s just a slog and I want out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This job also basically teases me every day with a morsel of what could be if I had any real applicable tech skills- I get to lightly dabble in things like teaching clients how to create reports and data visualizations in Looker, change some HTML and CSS on client sites, write some extremely basic SQL scripts, and if I&amp;#39;m lucky... occasionally change a value to fix something in a JavaScript function (that I only managed to figure out what it did by running through StackOverflow posts) so I don&amp;#39;t have to bother an actual developer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had any of these skills in a real capacity, I would be in a much better position. So... having said that... I am a 32-year-old Army veteran with about 36 months of GI Bill left. This puts me in the position to try a few routes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Bootcamp&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There exists a program (for veterans) where the govt will pay a tech bootcamp provider (Hack Reactor for example) for you to attend their program, as well as provide you with a monthly housing stipend. The program gets paid fully when you get a job. Zero risk and zero cost to me other than the risk of quitting my job and maybe not succeeding in the bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Degree &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could use my 36 months of GI Bill towards a CS type degree. &lt;del&gt;That would leave me with about 1 year to pay for myself assuming 4 years to finish.&lt;/del&gt; Risk is I quit my job and I waste my GI Bill and potentially up to 4 years on a degree that I might fail out of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Degree + Bootcamp combo&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;A blend of Option 1 and Option 2- I first use most of my GI Bill to pay for a degree, keep like 1 month or whatever on the books so I remain eligible for VET TEC, and then do a tech bootcamp right after graduation. Is it a waste to do both? Especially at my point in life? Same risk as the above really.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem with any of the degree routes is that I really think the math courses required alone would ruin me. I am just not good at it and barely survived the Algebra required for my management degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Option:&lt;/strong&gt; Bootcamp + Degree in adjacent field&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because why waste the 36 months of free school + rent?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doing just a bootcamp is the safest option and leaves my GI Bill intact just incase I don&amp;#39;t succeed to try for something else like an IT degree... but how does one truly prepare for something like this? I have read that many of the programs are difficult and fast paced- but also that you don&amp;#39;t need any prior experience?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would you recommend running through a handful of Udemy courses first before even considering it as an option? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anyone who has been in a similar situation?

Its gotten a couple responses, but not many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the responses it did get so far:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Was a referral as well and I got to a technical interview stage but bombed it. They wanted me to check if strings are palindromes and my first method wasnt efficient enough, and then took too much time to create / debug a character-by-character type of method so they rejected me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Did a phone screening and said hiring managers would get back to me. Holidays happened, I asked what was goin on, another 2 weeks go by and then I get a rejection email.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Did a phone screening and got assigned a take-home assignment. Submitted it, and was rejected. I asked for feedback on what I did wrong or if I messed up the assignment, but they told me its their policy to never give feedback on the interview process and that they can not say anything beyond a generic &amp;#39;we are pursuing other people with more experience&amp;#39;* On this note, could I PM anybody the assignment details and submission and check if it was &amp;#39;alright&amp;#39; by most standards? Obviously nobody can have the insight the company had, but I figure anybody experienced could look at it and at least tell me if the issue is that I am a complete idiot who has no business doing this, or if the issue was that somebody else probably did it better but there isnt necessarily anything wrong with me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am really struggling here, and due to life circumstances, relocation / applying to things across the country / WITCHes are not really an option for me at this time. I obviously should have buckled down and tried harder the day I graudated rather than waiting until last fall to really start applying. I&amp;#39;m stupid for that, but I can&amp;#39;t change the past. Unfortunately, my location really hampers the &amp;#39;Just throw 10 gazillion applications into the void and at least one will bite&amp;#39; strategy. Not too many junior roles currently posted around my area, so I&amp;#39;ve had to just yeet applications at whatever postings exist as long as they arent obviously out of my league / senior level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I currently spend most of my time working a part time job in the days to earn money to help my dad who I live with. Don&amp;#39;t really make much to save up, but its enough to help with my dad&amp;#39;s low wages and pay our bills. I might have to get a second part time job or find something full time, maybe help desk or something soon because money doesnt grow on trees and i desperately need to start saving money. Ideally I&amp;#39;d find a career, but life is life and I might have to just settle for whatever pays the bills and just have aspirations of making use of my degree some day.. bleh i dont wanna think about that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I am not occupied with that, I am trying to spend time to learn Spring Boot, practice with a database, and learn to interact with a RESTful API since I cant walk two feet without seeing a job require those. Unfortunately, my college didnt think those were relevant concepts to teach, so I have to self teach them. Its....a slow process. I think I am struggling with motivation issues resulting from poor mental health which is a result of extreme financial stress + the job search not going well + poor self image that I never really had a chance to address. These arent excuses, but they are factors that make it difficult for me to sit down and watch multi-hour videos and free courses about spring boot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(if anybody knows good resources for learning spring boot, please let me know :) youtuber videos seem extremely hit or miss and I am pretty confused by the topic at the moment)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is my issue that I&amp;#39;m stupid? Is my resume a war crime to look at? do I just need more experience / projects / skills to list on my resume (like listing spring boot and APIs?) Am I screwed because its been so long since May 2022 with no roles?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Wanna_make_cash&quot;&gt; /u/Wanna_make_cash &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10mxg8h/what_can_i_do_better_as_a_new_grad_looking_for_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10mxg8h/what_can_i_do_better_as_a_new_grad_looking_for_a/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10mxg8h</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10mxg8h/what_can_i_do_better_as_a_new_grad_looking_for_a/" /><updated>2023-01-27T22:02:08+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-27T22:02:08+00:00</published><title>What can I do better as a new grad looking for a career?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/thelonelyward2</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/thelonelyward2</uri></author><category term="cscareerquestions" label="r/cscareerquestions"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work for a company, and we have 2 day a week policy in the office.

My current challenge is that I&amp;#39;m not sure what search terms to use to get a job that&amp;#39;s similar to what I currently do. I work at an AI startup as a &amp;quot;solutions engineer&amp;quot;. But at other places the same title seems to refer to something distinct. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I currently do:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extend and build on top of the company&amp;#39;s proprietary AI framework. Over the course of my year and a half, this has meant developing machine vision pipelines, modules that handle knowledge representation and reasoning (which included using probabilistic graphical models, clustering algorithms, information theory, among other things), planning (with A* search), and reinforcement learning (passing knowledge of Q tables...). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data analysis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All development done in Python, with some Bash scripting done as needed. Other tools I use and have become familiar with: docker (including writing Dockerfiles) and git. I develop on a computer running Ubuntu and so am familiar with Unix-like systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Develop custom solutions for clients using my company&amp;#39;s proprietary AI framework. Development of those solutions requires data pre-preprocessing, designing a network topology and developing any additional modules necessary to augment the base framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concerns:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not have formal background in any of this. I graduated with a bachelor&amp;#39;s in math and did not have much in the way of programming or CS knowledge prior to joining the company. I was initially hired on as a data analyst, but it seems that after the first month or so, things shifted around that I was now working on developing actual ML/AI . I have no illusions regarding my skillset. All the things I listed in the first bullet point in the list above are things that I am not at all an &amp;quot;expert in&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m proficient in them under a generous definition of the word &amp;quot;proficient&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s more accurate to say that I have a decent foundation in ML fundamentals at this point (regression, PCA, SVM, etc.), but a passing understanding in most of what I mentioned above. I knew enough about them to write up modules using Python libraries and already existing repositories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above point has left me feeling that I have few skills that can be transferred to a similar job working in AI. Most jobs like that would want at least a master&amp;#39;s degree and/or years of experience to the point of expertise in various relevant topics in ML. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently making $80,000 and am hoping to find a place where I can enjoy a salary increase while also working on projects I deem fun, like the kinds I work on here.

Should I choose something like data analysis since I&amp;#39;ll be working with databases?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Hi_ILikeShorts&quot;&gt; /u/Hi_ILikeShorts &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10na9oo/what_cs_specialization/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10na9oo/what_cs_specialization/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10na9oo</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10na9oo/what_cs_specialization/" /><updated>2023-01-28T08:34:32+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-28T08:34:32+00:00</published><title>What CS Specialization</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ezomar</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ezomar</uri></author><category term="cscareerquestions" label="r/cscareerquestions"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m currently a CS major but I have the option of doing a joint major with business as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It won’t add more time to my degree but I won’t have the flexibility to take more upper year CS electives for example if I want to finish with just 120 credits.

I&amp;#39;m fairly proficient in Java, and I have some experience working with Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and frameworks such as Angular, Spring, Node.js. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve forgotten a huge amount of what I&amp;#39;ve learnt over the last few years, and I don&amp;#39;t really have a github full of side projects that I&amp;#39;ve worked on in my free time like some of my classmates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m desperate to gain real world experience, and as such I&amp;#39;m open to any junior/entry-level software engineering position. I&amp;#39;m currently applying to several job postings a day via LinkedIn, and so far have been called into a single interview which didn&amp;#39;t transpire into anything concrete. I&amp;#39;m also in the process of further developing a relatively advanced application based on hexagonal architecture that I created for my Bachelor project, which I hope will make me stand out a little from other candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s imposter syndrome, but I genuinely feel like I&amp;#39;m somewhat at the bottom of the barrel compared to many of my classmates who already have secured jobs, and who I feel are far more accomplished than I am, despite us receiving the same education. What can I do, which areas/strategies can I pursue that will promote my as of yet non-existing career in IT? I apologize if this post comes across as somewhat messy and unstructured, it&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve put all these thoughts into words.

Maybe wordpress development is an area in the IT software field where you cannot earn lots of money as an employee. I&amp;#39;m in my 20s and my main goal is to finish my bachelor study. But I am a bit anxious that I have difficulties to make career in the IT field because I don&amp;#39;t have experience besides web development. I do think that I want to stay in the web development field, but I am not sure if I want to stay in the wordpress area. I do think that most companies do look for react/angular/etc. developers and they might earn more. Also things like cloud computing sounds interesting but it might be difficult to enter this area without skills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think?
