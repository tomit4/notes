My nickname is literally Sticks because of my size. I recently started going to the gym ( yesterday was my first trip). I would&amp;#39;ve started sooner but for the past year and 10months I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with/ recovering from a back injury I received in a car accident (not my fault). To add I know most people are gonna say eat This, That, and the other. I&amp;#39;m going to be working with a nutritionist who knows me personally and knows how picky of an eater I am he gives me crap about it but gets it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the advice I&amp;#39;m looking for isn&amp;#39;t really diet, or workouts it&amp;#39;s more of how did you feel once you hit your weight goal? and How did people treat you after? And How did you overcome your hurdles of feeling like you weren&amp;#39;t getting anywhere? that last one is where I always have gave up on trying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of always being &amp;quot;told eat a burger&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t turn sideways so we can still see you&amp;quot; so yeah thank you any comments in advance.

I stayed decently lean, and have made great gains but I feel like now that I&amp;#39;m at a more normal weight and level of strength, my gains have plateau&amp;#39;d from my &amp;quot;do whatever I feel like doing&amp;quot; routine which was basically just doing a full-body workout 4-5x a week. My ideal weight is anywhere from 170-180 with 12-15% bodyfat and if I had to guess honestly I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m probably around 18% at the moment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on a [push, pull, legs, push, pull] split with two rest days thrown inbetween for the past couple of weeks now and I&amp;#39;d like to hear some thoughts on my current routine and how to improve it for my goals of hypertrophy, strength, and skill. I&amp;#39;m aiming for a certain body aesthetic while wanting to do all the typical cool calisthenics moves. I saw the comprehensive front lever video the other day from Doctor Yaad and that video is absolutely amazing but it got me unsure of how viable my own routine is since he splits his training into several weeks dedicated to hypertrophy, and several weeks dedicated to skill. Right now I&amp;#39;m training expecting strength, hypertrophy, and skill gains. Is this suboptimal training?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is all based on what I&amp;#39;m actually able to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PUSH:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x8 Pike Push-Up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2x20 Decline Push-Up (I plan to get this to the 8-12 range through adding weight or going slower, and then maybe make it 3 sets)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x10s Planche Lean&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x Frogstand to failure (I always lose balance within a few seconds so it&amp;#39;s not muscular failure)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PULL: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x8 Wide Pull-up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x5 Explosive Pull-up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x10s Front Lever Progression&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x2 Skin the Cat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LEGS:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x5 Assisted Pistol Squat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x5 Kneeling Quad Press&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x5 Shrimp Squat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PUSH:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x8 Pike Push-Up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x8 Ring Dips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x5 Archer Push-Up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3x Frogstand to failure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PULL: Same as first pull day.

Lately I have discovered radio calisthenics, a type of exercise apparently popular in some Asian countries. Here is an example video I have been using: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FcrGLCHT08&quot;&gt;RADIO TAISO - „É©„Ç∏„Ç™‰ΩìÊìç&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else enjoy this kind of thing? It obviously does not train strength in any sense. If anything, it probably trains mobility and MAYBE borderline cardio. But I think it is fun, and find that I feel pretty good afterwards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder if there is a separate term to refer to these types of calisthenics as distinct from things like pushups/pullups. I think it would be awesome if there were more difficult variations of different movements, and maybe even progressions, but I have no idea what &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; movement-calisthenics would even look like. I have been thinking about trying to develop something like that, if anyone would be interested in such a project. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Gas-Programmatically&quot;&gt; /u/Gas-Programmatically &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10lpoon/movementmobility_based_calisthenics_radio/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10lpoon/movementmobility_based_calisthenics_radio/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10lpoon</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10lpoon/movementmobility_based_calisthenics_radio/" /><updated>2023-01-26T11:27:18+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-26T11:27:18+00:00</published><title>Movement/Mobility based Calisthenics (Radio Calisthenics/Taiso)</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ThanDrazz</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ThanDrazz</uri></author><category term="bodyweightfitness" label="r/bodyweightfitness"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone to give me workout regimen, with body weight and cardio, and a diet.

On one hand I really want my workouts to be as effective as possible, on the other I am worried of injuries because I know that injuries kill progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you all for any input you can provide!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/clemmat85&quot;&gt; /u/clemmat85 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kxoym/how_exhausted_should_i_be_after_finishing_a_serie/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kxoym/how_exhausted_should_i_be_after_finishing_a_serie/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10kxoym</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kxoym/how_exhausted_should_i_be_after_finishing_a_serie/" /><updated>2023-01-25T12:39:17+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-25T12:39:17+00:00</published><title>How exhausted should I be after finishing a serie, or workout?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ayymuhd</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ayymuhd</uri></author><category term="bodyweightfitness" label="r/bodyweightfitness"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey guys, relatively new to this page.

I imagine that a few sets of climbs would be set as your main moment at the start of the training session, but I am struggling with what supplemental lifts/movements and how much volume I can/should really add afterwards.

Hang up two ring straps and put some kind of bar or rod that can securely support your body weight through the straps to make a trapeze swing. For a greater degree of difficulty (and security so that the bar doesn&amp;#39;t slip out of the straps) you can make a free spinning one with a wooden rod and swivel eye screws through the ends that attach to carabiners + the straps. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain but it has a completely different feeling than rings or bar work, you have to stabilize so hard to not start swinging. Going chest to bar on a free spinning one will wreck you even if you&amp;#39;ve been at this a while like me. Encourage you guys to try it out, of course be careful and be certain in the integrity of your setup before attempting it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Snowmerdinger7&quot;&gt; /u/Snowmerdinger7 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kz8m0/want_to_mix_things_up_trapeze_bar_work/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kz8m0/want_to_mix_things_up_trapeze_bar_work/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10kz8m0</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kz8m0/want_to_mix_things_up_trapeze_bar_work/" /><updated>2023-01-25T13:59:40+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-25T13:59:40+00:00</published><title>Want to Mix Things Up? - Trapeze Bar Work</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/AutoModerator</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator</uri></author><category term="bodyweightfitness" label="r/bodyweightfitness"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/&quot;&gt;r/bodyweightfitness&lt;/a&gt; Daily Discussion thread!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the place to post simple questions, anecdotes, achievements, or just about anything that&amp;#39;s on your mind related to fitness!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminders:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; as your question may be answered there already.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Our two main beginner routines are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/kofo8l/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_1_happy/&quot;&gt;BWF Primer Routine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/routines/bwsf/&quot;&gt;Bodyweight Strength Foundation (BWSF) Routine&lt;/a&gt;.

If you you&amp;#39;re not fit (like I used to be sooo long time in completly different shapes) it&amp;#39;s completly normal to hate Calishtenics and fitness in general. I used to hate it, but pushed myself into new limits until I reached a point where pushups become easy, and after that even fun. Pull ups became fun, all the basics became fun, doing new stuff is fun, because you&amp;#39;ll feel extremely better in your body. Trust the progress and trust me when I say, that you&amp;#39;ll eventually fall in love with any kind of fitness once you become good in it. Don&amp;#39;t say fitness isn&amp;#39;t for you, because you don&amp;#39;t have fun doing it. The fun is not the beginning and sometimes even not the fitness itself, but the reflection in the mirror you finally like, the new move you can show to your family, the feeling of relieve after you know you did the right thing. Start you journey now if you haven&amp;#39;t already and always remember consistency is key. Now drop down and gimme 20!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MegaPentra&quot;&gt; /u/MegaPentra &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10jgz7z/yes_fitness_becomes_more_fun_the_better_you_are/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10jgz7z/yes_fitness_becomes_more_fun_the_better_you_are/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10jgz7z</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10jgz7z/yes_fitness_becomes_more_fun_the_better_you_are/" /><updated>2023-01-23T16:46:11+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-23T16:46:11+00:00</published><title>Yes, fitness becomes more fun the better you are at it.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/mt5z</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/mt5z</uri></author><category term="bodyweightfitness" label="r/bodyweightfitness"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr - question is in the title&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found a progressive pullup program, that supposes to take me from 5-10 (my current max is 9-10) to 20 pullups in a row in 6 weeks, created by FitnessFAQ ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/RMtlbOIBAY0&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/RMtlbOIBAY0&lt;/a&gt; ). I&amp;#39;ve been always sceptical about programs with fixed number of reps in it, as what I&amp;#39;ve learned to trigger hypertrophy you must take the muscles close to failure, and programs tend to start very easy. So does this one. BUT I need to reset myself, as I have a feeling that I grinded too hard, my joints hurt and I don&amp;#39;t see any significant progress, so I&amp;#39;ve figured that maybe is time to trust a professional...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For reference, I&amp;#39;ve been doing inconsistent trainings for a year, had a two months break and then for about 6 months started to work out consistently. As said, I can do 9-10 clean pullups (but I used to do 14 before consistent working... it might be due to the fact that I had a bar high enough to keep my whole body straight, and now I must bend my knees...), and 17-19 dips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t started the program yet, I&amp;#39;d like to get some answers first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Program is made to train 3 times a week and it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Week 1: 3 days x 6 sets x 5 reps &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W2: 2 days x 3x8 + 1x6, 1 day 3 x 9-10 reps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W3: 2 days x 6x6, 1 day 5 x 6-8&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W4: 3 days x 3x 10-12 reps &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W5: 3 days x 2 x 10-15 reps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;W6: 3 days x 3 x 10-15 reps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What worries me is the big leap between week 3rd and 4th. I mean, I could easily complete week 3 (in my last pullup workout I did 9-9-8-8-7-5), but to complete week 4, I would have to stop by 8th-9th rep, rest 20-30 seconds and force those 2-4 reps more, and as far as I understand, the goal is to do all sets without letting the bar go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So maybe it&amp;#39;s a trust issue, of it&amp;#39;s really worth it. I mean, I don&amp;#39;t want to waste my time. From the other hand, doing what I thought was right, wasn&amp;#39;t really the best option either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do you think, is this doable, reasonable program that have a chance to work and really progress me somewhat closer to 20 clean reps in a row, although it starts so easy? And the question from the beginning: do I just repeat a workout untill I complete given numbers, if I fail to do it on a first attempt?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And maybe it makes sense to modify it; start from week 3, repeat it twice and then try to go further?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And another very important question: will it be a good idea to do 2 or 3 sets of inverted rows after pullups, just to get more volume, or should I focus on those pullups exclusively? But it seems so little, for last months I&amp;#39;ve been doing 3 sets of weighted chins, followed by 3 sets of myo reps inverted rows, every two or three days... But than again, it didn&amp;#39;t work that great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I&amp;#39;m just confused, trying to work my way out of beginner stage. Any advice will be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also: do you think does it makes sense to apply this program to weighted dips, heavy enough to fail before 10 reps?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/mt5z&quot;&gt; /u/mt5z &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kdq0m/if_i_cant_complete_prescribed_number_of_reps_in_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kdq0m/if_i_cant_complete_prescribed_number_of_reps_in_a/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10kdq0m</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/10kdq0m/if_i_cant_complete_prescribed_number_of_reps_in_a/" /><updated>2023-01-24T19:24:29+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-24T19:24:29+00:00</published><title>If I can't complete prescribed number of reps in a program, do I repeat a workout until I can or how to manage it?</title></entry></feed>
