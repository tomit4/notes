F500 Health Insurance company, fully remote, good base salary. Im so excited! You all can do it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stats: ~200 applications, 5 interviews, 1 offer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience: 1 internship (8 weeks) from no name startup. Graduated from state university December 2022. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the current economic climate many places are still hiring. Dont lose hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update to help those in the job search:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your resume is the most important part of all this. Get it reviewed by multiple people. There’s subreddits dedicated to resume reviews, and there are even professional resume/cover letter builders that may be worth the money. If youre not getting interviews, it’s because your resume isnt good enough. Add keywords, impactful bullets/stats, etc. If you dont have internships, make projects and hyperlink them in your resume pdf. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Linkedin connection can also help as its a path to reach out to recruiters, and if you have premium you can see if your page is getting any attention (if it is, then youve got something marketable about you).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strategy thats worked for me was quality over quantity. Apply to positions where youre actually really interested in, or positions that fall in line with your expertise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leetcode isnt as important as everyone makes it seem. Before you make it to the leetcode portion of the interview, you gotta make it past the phone screen, then the initial interview. Work on your personality, be charismatic, be someone you would want to have a conversation with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, its a numbers game. You want to aim for a 5-10% app to interview rate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope you all will find success in your job search.

The internships and FT recruiting grind is tough to say the least. I didn’t have people to talk to honestly about stuff back then, but I was fortunate to meet some upperclassmen who went out of their way to take me under their wings to show me how things were done. I love the fact that people in this subreddit are here to answer questions for people like me back then.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try and pay their generosity forward in whatever way I can, I started by going through this subreddit’s resume review/roast thread to see how I could help. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/&quot;&gt;r/csMajors&lt;/a&gt; is full of bright individuals who’ve accomplished so much. Yet, some resumes made it hard for me understand, in just one scan, what candidates have done previously. I would love to individually submit feedback for each resume, but unfortunately I get caught up with things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the tech industry continues to face layoffs and economic uncertainty, it&amp;#39;s more important than ever to make sure your resume stands out from the rest. A tight, well-written resume can mean the difference between getting an interview and being overlooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m by no means a recruiter. But, after submitting hundreds of resumes and reviewing hundreds more, I&amp;#39;ve found that the resumes that stood out the most had these four key elements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(If you consume information better via videos, here’s the same content but with visuals: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN_myIGkEtM&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN_myIGkEtM&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll try to supplement each point with examples. And I’m happy to try and answer more specific followup queries:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They were easy to read.Stick to simple templates and familiar fonts (Times New Roman, Garamond, and Arial are your best bets). It’s ok to be visually boring; this isn’t where you should stand out. Make sure your resume answers the important questions in an order that makes sense. This is the template I used - it’s a modified version of my college’s career service office’s template. But, it works. No fluff, no weird structuring. Link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfIwLW1NxNHBDTx6_TVTAtwCtYgi_McwmuF8-OwopvU/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfIwLW1NxNHBDTx6_TVTAtwCtYgi_McwmuF8-OwopvU/edit?usp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;Recruiters spend on average 6-8 seconds looking at your resume. What this means is that recruiters come up with a quite binary response to your resume, “yes” or “no”. You’ve already done the hard work of doing projects and working as interns. Help recruiters get to a “yes” for you.Keep most bullet points to just a single line. Don’t try to explain too many things with each bullet point. This will force you to be concise while making it easier for recruiters to follow you.&lt;br/&gt; Ex.If you’re looking for internships or new-grad opportunities, I personally recommend sticking to this structure from top to bottom: personal info → education → work experience → projects/university leadership → skills &amp;amp; interestsOnce you’ve graduated and you much more work experience under your belts, you can prioritize work experience over education and perhaps get rid of “projects” altogether.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They articulated the applicant&amp;#39;s impact.Buzzwords alone don’t effectively communicate your accomplishments. Highlight what you did and your impact as the front-and-center item and don&amp;#39;t include unnecessary details. Companies are interested in your ability to provide impact, not just in your ability to master dozens of technical frameworks.It can be so easy to lose ourselves in listing the technical implementation details. But your resume should highlight the cream of the crop - the best of the best that you’ve done so far. Talk about the RESULTS of your work and WHAT you did to help teams succeed over nitty-gritty “HOW”.&lt;br/&gt; Ex.&amp;lt;Bad&amp;gt; ”Built a full-stack web-application using ReactJS and NodeJS frameworks for the company’s promotional website.”&amp;lt;Better&amp;gt; ”Drove 100% of new sign ups by engineering company’s promo-website from scratch in ReactJS and NodeJS”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They used numbers and metrics to quantify the applicant&amp;#39;s impact.Show, support, and dramatize the impact of your previous work by putting metrics and numbers all over your accomplishments.Numbers are a shared language between engineers and recruiters. Your fellow engineers might know how challenging it must have been to write certain APIs, but recruiters might not. However, they certainly know what it means to enable certain experiences for users, to drive sign-ups, and to bring in thousands of dollars in revenue to your company due to your feature engineering.A quick playbook for how to make your bulletpoints stand out with numbers:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;First, define the most impactful thing you did &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;features you built, classes taught, debugging, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Second, what metric did that thing move? &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;revenue, new sign-ups, user engagement, student engagement, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Third, how much of that metric did you move? &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;$? %? Resources saved?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ex.Let’s use the same example from above. Say you built out a promotional website for a company end-to-end. The thing you did is easy to identify, it’s the website you built. The metric you moved is probably new users that were attracted to the company’s products due to the website. Finally, think about how many new users you attracted in sheer numbers of percentages, and pick whichever looks more impressive.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They boasted the applicant&amp;#39;s individuality. Show that you&amp;#39;re an independent thinker by pursuing projects that you truly care about.Building projects on your own is tough and challenging, so make it enjoyable for yourself at least! If you have hobbies, frame the goal of your projects to be in the world of your hobbies. You will have so much fun and your project will be more interesting and intriguing.At some point down the road in the recruiting timeline, you’ll get asked a question, “what’s something you’ve built that you take pride in”. This question prods the candidate’s ability to talk about what they did and their individuality. What do you care about, what have you worked on around what you care about, etc. You’ll have such an easy time answering this with projects you’re passionate about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ex.I loved teaching since high school. Throughout college I took any and all opportunities to teach programming and coding to students of all ages, domestically and internationally. I just had a genuine blast working with students and like-minded teachers from all over the world. And, it was by far one of the things that made me standout as a candidate through the recruiting cycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bonus. Write your hobbies and interests at the very bottom&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might have interviews in which you’ll connect immediately with the interviewer based on your interests and hobbies :) Easy way to add a dimension to yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ZebraGlydesMemes&quot;&gt; /u/ZebraGlydesMemes &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mnipv/make_your_resume_standout_with_these_4_rules_and/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mnipv/make_your_resume_standout_with_these_4_rules_and/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10mnipv</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mnipv/make_your_resume_standout_with_these_4_rules_and/" /><updated>2023-01-27T15:26:13+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-27T15:26:13+00:00</published><title>Make your resume standout with these 4 rules (and a bonus)</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/babycakestrash</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/babycakestrash</uri></author><category term="csMajors" label="r/csMajors"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a long conversation with a coworker who talked about having 4 internships, two of them with FAANG, and admitted to me that he didn&amp;#39;t learn anything in those internships and that his internships were &amp;quot;bullshit&amp;quot;, meaning he didn&amp;#39;t really do or learn anything. He complimented my skills on Linux, and told me that I would be a better fit for his roles. For some context, I&amp;#39;m still trying to get my first internship as a junior. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get an internship since last Spring (got interviews, always rejected after), and cannot for the life of me figure out what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong. It&amp;#39;s an extremely frustrating experience. It&amp;#39;s draining, and I&amp;#39;m wishing I did engineering instead due to the grind culture that&amp;#39;s been highly manufactured by a handful of tech oligarchies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This made me wonder: I could be the best programmer on earth, but because I don&amp;#39;t have his titles, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything to any employer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other STEM student subreddits are always full of memes and general &amp;quot;water cooler&amp;quot; talk about their field. Yet, this subreddit is nonstop, dissatisfied undergrads mindlessly grinding and grinding for the hope that maybe they&amp;#39;ll land a internship. It&amp;#39;s all about internships. A microsoft engineer told me that employers don&amp;#39;t care if you have a CS degree, they only want to see if you have internships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet, every internship requires you to be pursuing a CS degree?

Any insight is much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/doelcm0&quot;&gt; /u/doelcm0 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n4lpg/how_long_until_you_hear_back_for_a_potential/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n4lpg/how_long_until_you_hear_back_for_a_potential/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10n4lpg</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n4lpg/how_long_until_you_hear_back_for_a_potential/" /><updated>2023-01-28T03:13:32+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-28T03:13:32+00:00</published><title>How long until you hear back for a potential interview?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/meagainstmyselff</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/meagainstmyselff</uri></author><category term="csMajors" label="r/csMajors"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title says it all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/meagainstmyselff&quot;&gt; /u/meagainstmyselff &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mqd45/how_many_hours_do_you_study_per_day/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mqd45/how_many_hours_do_you_study_per_day/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10mqd45</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10mqd45/how_many_hours_do_you_study_per_day/" /><updated>2023-01-27T17:20:38+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-27T17:20:38+00:00</published><title>How many hours do you study per day?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/princezuko123</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/princezuko123</uri></author><category term="csMajors" label="r/csMajors"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;recruiter reached out to me saying that i’m gonna have a coding assessment next week. can any one who has completed it provide some insight?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/princezuko123&quot;&gt; /u/princezuko123 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n6yqm/meta_swe_intern_not_university_coding_assessment/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n6yqm/meta_swe_intern_not_university_coding_assessment/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10n6yqm</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/10n6yqm/meta_swe_intern_not_university_coding_assessment/" /><updated>2023-01-28T05:15:06+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-28T05:15:06+00:00</published><title>meta swe intern (not university) coding assessment</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/zanesixnine</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/zanesixnine</uri></author><category term="csMajors" label="r/csMajors"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I applied for an internship and got an &amp;quot;offer&amp;quot;, but apparently I can&amp;#39;t get an offer letter because the CEO has to sign off on my offer, and my HM doesn&amp;#39;t want to give the CEO an offer to sign unless he knows I&amp;#39;ll accept?
