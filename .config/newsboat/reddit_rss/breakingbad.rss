I&amp;#39;m Just curious if I am the only one who does this. I was in college when Breaking Bad aired. I never saw a single episode. Met my wife in 2014 and she thought it was insane that I didn&amp;#39;t see any of the episodes so we binged it. And then binged it two more times since then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So for almost a decade, I will drop a Breaking Bad quote on her during certain moments. Whenever we are having some type of argument, usually trivial, I will just shout out &amp;quot;I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS!&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m not exageratting either lol.. I&amp;#39;ve done this for like 8 years lmao. She always laughs even though I know she&amp;#39;s super annoyed. A couple times she would interupt and say &amp;quot;dont you fucking say it&amp;quot;.

Towards the end of the show, Walt had achieved such infamy that he was basically stranded in a house apart from the occasional visit from The Disappearer and ended up becoming so lonely as a result that he eventually paid him 10K to stay with him for a little bit longer. This loneliness was a result of how wanted he was by the authorities. All this to say that Jesse is likely due the same loneliness. He was Walter&amp;#39;s partner, his only equal and a companion to him throughout almost every criminal act so it stands to reason that the authorities want him as much as they did Walt and so Jesse is probably destined to become depressed and lonely in whatever remote cabin he has waiting for him in Alaska. In short, he&amp;#39;s basically swapped a small prison for a slightly larger one but doesn&amp;#39;t realise it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s just my take, I could be looking at it all wrong, feel free to comment your thoughts :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Physical-Chain2060&quot;&gt; /u/Physical-Chain2060 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/10mu5rx/el_caminos_depressing_implication/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/10mu5rx/el_caminos_depressing_implication/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10mu5rx</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/10mu5rx/el_caminos_depressing_implication/" /><updated>2023-01-27T19:49:07+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-27T19:49:07+00:00</published><title>El Camino's depressing implication</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/cant_read_this</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/cant_read_this</uri></author><category term="breakingbad" label="r/breakingbad"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a quick scene with Walter pulling into the laundry mat place to go cook.

Was that the intention?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;ll give more specifics and context for those interested). So I&amp;#39;m watching Breaking Bad for the first time while I&amp;#39;m off work with a cold, and this is the first show in YEARS that has hooked me so much that I binge watch it. I just finished season 4, but I do know maybe 2 or 3 of the main plot points/beats of the final season (the ending, a few deaths, and where a few relationships end up by the end of the show), just not the rest or the context/journey to said moments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think knowing quite a lot of the major developments let me know to constantly distrust Walt&amp;#39;s choices and be very critical of basically anything he says. So when &amp;quot;Face Off&amp;quot; comes to an end, and Walt has his &amp;quot;badass&amp;quot; (ok, even with my interpretation, it&amp;#39;s still quite badass) &amp;quot;I won&amp;quot; line, I immediately started reading into it (possibly way too much, which is why I&amp;#39;m asking the community via this post). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You all know far better than I that Walt is dangerously narcissistic, especially by season 4. And while he still is just as sociopathic, if not moreso, in the last few episodes of the season (I personally percieved episodes 9 (&amp;quot;Bug) through to 13 (&amp;quot;Face Off&amp;quot;) as essentially a multi-episode finale), Walt exhibits more vulnerability than before, such as his inability to control his greed or ego with what I think was more instances of uncontrolled outbursts over calculated mind games and long cons, and hidden (and sometimes not-so-hidden) breakdowns fueled by emotional+mental stress. Crying to Flynn, willing to give everything up so he can disappear with his family, the ending of &amp;quot;Crawl Space&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me, these reactions that were more prominent in the later half of season 4 implied Walt, now facing the urgent and dire consequences of working in the major league narcotics industry, was overwhelmed and quickly losing confidence in his ambitions/abilities which had fuelled everything up until now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was scared and uncertain before the final few episodes even happened. So when they do happen, and he&amp;#39;s forced to confront endless grave challenges and delicate situations, Walt really, really struggles. He doesn&amp;#39;t have many moments where he utilities a cool-head, quick thinking, and manipulation to completely overcome obstacles. He largely has no scenes where he engages in an argument or discussion and manages to take advantage of the scenario while promoting this image of himself that always has complete control of his surroundings with his superior intellect. He begs, yells, cries, and multiple times is visibly completely unable to know where to even begin. All this is happening while he is being actively targeted by Gus, the strict professional with far more experience, resources, and knowledge of the criminal world than Walt could ever dream of having.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when Walt does manage to eliminate Gus, it&amp;#39;s not so much a grand strategy to end a disturbed, intricate war for power between two opposing armies. Walt has been just barely surviving in what is essentially Gus&amp;#39; world. Walt at least seemed to be simply trying to take control of his space within Gus&amp;#39; world, with little to no apparent intention of overthrowing Gus completely and becoming the sole leader of an entire drug empire. He wanted to kill Gus purely to ensure his and his families safety, albeit unable to let go of his need to maintain control of his space, ego, and masculinity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why does he reflect on this at the end and see it as a victory? He didn&amp;#39;t survive, he didn&amp;#39;t stop Gus - he &amp;quot;won&amp;quot;. He specifically chooses the word &amp;quot;won&amp;quot;. People don&amp;#39;t win or lose survival, Gus and Walt were never equals competing, it was a man desperately running from the real danger. This whole experience should have shown Walt the true, horrifying dangers of how hubris attracts the darkest sides of organised crime. Its a miracle everyone survived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But no.
