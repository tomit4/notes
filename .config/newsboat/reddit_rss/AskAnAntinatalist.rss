We thank everyone for having participated in all the interesting discussions we've had in our comparatively short run.

Shoutout because I believe you deserve the acknowledgement,thank you for taking over and taking care of this sub for me. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway,getting to the point,I feel it is time to post an update in regards to our FAQ and here it is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About the Philosophy and its Criteria&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is antinatalism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A philosophical position that assigns a negative moral value to birth and hypothetically-related processes (ex. human cloning, artificial intelligence, consciousness digitization &amp;amp; copying, etc.). &lt;strong&gt;In future answers, this will be referred to as &amp;quot;birth &amp;amp; related actions.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What do I have to do in order to be an antinatalist?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assign a negative moral value to birth &amp;amp; related actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What views are incompatible with antinatalism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember the definition: assigning a negative moral value to birth &amp;amp; related actions. Therefore, there are 3 general ways one can outright contradict this definition:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By assigning a positive moral value to birth. Natalism is the primary example of contradiction this premise. &lt;strong&gt;Natalists cannot be antinatalists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By hypothesizing that there is no moral framework with which values can be assigned. If there is no framework, you can&amp;#39;t make a negative moral assignment [to anything, including birth]. Moral nihlism is the primary example in this case. &lt;strong&gt;Moral nihlists cannot be antinatalists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By only assigning a negative moral value to certain cases or circumstances of birth &amp;amp; related actions (ex. &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s only unethical for the poor to procreate; the rich can do so as they wish&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;These incompatibilities are based strictly on the previously-stated definition of antinatalism. Anything outside the definition treads upon the No True Scotsman Fallacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Does that mean a parent can be an antinatalist?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the definition, as long as they view birth as a negative moral action, yes. While procreating in spite of holding such a view is hypocritical and basically the antithesis of antinatalism, there is no tenet in antinatalism that says &amp;quot;thou shall not have children&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many parents may be forced into such a position in the first place despite their personal views on the matter being antinatalist. Based on subreddit interaction, some of these cases may simply be harsh accidents. The antinatalist community wishes such parents the best of circumstance and hopes that they can raise their children as individuals who could understand the ethical stakes of procreation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Does that mean a religious person can be an antinatalist?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: the supermajority of antinatalists are not religious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the definition, as long as those religious persons disagree with any religious notions of birth being a moral good, yes. It can even be argued that existence of god and afterlife gives us even more reasons not to procreate - after all, our child might be condemned to eternal suffering in hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Does that mean an anti-abortion person can be an antinatalist?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: the supermajority of antinatalists are pro-abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the definition, as long as those anti-abortion individuals still view birth as an evil outcome, yes. To these individuals, birth is the lesser evil between it versus [what they view as] murder. But &lt;strong&gt;the fact that they assign a negative moral value to birth&lt;/strong&gt; makes them antinatalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is antinatalism&amp;#39;s end goal?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For there to be no birth or anything emulating it (i.e. cloning, synthesizing a bonafide self-aware A.I, etc.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Doesn&amp;#39;t that mean everything will die out?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a byproduct, not the intent. Besides, what happened to the bubbling enthusiasm people have about overcoming obstacles? Go out and find a way to stop death instead of handing the burden down the line. Tick tock, your time is running out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Does antinatalism view some births as more unethical than others?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No. All births are equally unethical in the view of antinatalism. However, antinatalists may hold other views that necessitate a classification of &amp;quot;the degree of wrongfulness&amp;quot;. Antinatalism, on its own, however, does not have such a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Shouldn&amp;#39;t this subreddit only be about antinatalism? Why allow antinatalists to state their utility and/or virtue-based ethics alongside antinatalism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because then the subreddit would have only one post and it would be titled &amp;quot;Birth is bad, m&amp;#39;kay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is Benatar&amp;#39;s Asymmetry?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benatar&amp;#39;s asymmetry is a specific argument for antinatalism, outlined by the philosopher David Benatar. The premises of the argument are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;the presence of pain is bad; 2) the presence of pleasure is good; 3) the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone; whereas 4) the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation. (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/benatar&quot;&gt;http://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/benatar&lt;/a&gt;) This argument leads to the conclusion that being born is always harmful to the individual and thus, that it is immoral to bring new people into existence. While many antinatalists accept this view, it is possible to be an antinatalist on other grounds while rejecting the asymmetry.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About the Philosophy&amp;#39;s Relationships to Other Philosophies or Views&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is the difference between antinatalism, promortalism, and efilism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;They address different aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, antinatalism. It is the assignment of a negative moral value &lt;strong&gt;to birth&lt;/strong&gt;. Notice the lack of any statement about other parts of life. Keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, promortalism. As the etymology of the word says, it is the assignment of a positive value &lt;strong&gt;to death&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, notice the lack of any statement about other parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, efilism. It is the assignment of a negative overall value &lt;strong&gt;to the entirety of life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s walk through some scenarios and see if you understood the above:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person A: &amp;quot;I think bringing someone into being is horrible because it breaches consent. But life is a good experience and I will see their eventual death as a bad thing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person A is: antinatalist, NOT efilist, NOT promortalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person B: &amp;quot;I think bringing someone into being is horrible. This life is a horrendous, constant struggle from which death is a blessing that finally frees them from it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person B is: antinatalist, efilist, and promortalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person C: &amp;quot;I think bringing new life into being is a blessing. Life is beautiful because that someone gets to overcome challenges, and my spiritual belief is that death guides them to an even greater state of being afterwards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person C is: NOT antinatalist, NOT efilist, but is promortalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person D: &amp;quot;I think life is beautiful, that birthing is the greatest experience a woman can go through, and I can&amp;#39;t stand the thought of death.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Person D is: NOT antinatalist, NOT efilist, NOT promortalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is the relationship between antinatalism and environmentalism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antinatalism should not be confused with arguments to reduce the human population on environmental grounds. Antinatalism is a philosophical position, and if correct thus would apply whether the earth was judged by environmentalists to be overpopulated or not. That is to say, any birth or fertility rate above zero is deemed unacceptable regardless of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/NnnqQ4v&quot;&gt;Many antinatalists support environmentalism on account of the pursuit of eco-friendliness strongly involving a reduction in birth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• What is the relationship between antinatalism and veganism?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a common belief that antinatalism doesn&amp;#39;t apply only to humans, but to other animals as well. Therefore, avoiding animal products is morally good, as it results in less farm animals being born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Is there a relationship between antinatalism and positive eugenics?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No. Positive eugenics would still involve the prescription of positive value to certain births on the basis of characteristics such as race. Antinatalism is opposed to all births. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/wiki/beginnersguide#wiki_.2022_what_views_can_i_hold_and_still_be_compatible_with_antinatalism.3F_what_views_are_incompatible_with_antinatalism.3F&quot;&gt;This ties back to the earlier section involving Category #3 under the views that are incompatible with antinatalism.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Does antinatalism imply the desirability of suicide?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, it doesn&amp;#39;t. It is a very common misconception among people unfamiliar with the view. Although antinatalists believe that life is not worth starting, it doesn&amp;#39;t imply that life is not worth continuing once started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Posts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/5ycm9j/why_dont_you_just_commit_suicide_if_life_is_so_bad/&quot;&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t you just commit suicide if life is so bad?&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;/u/blondeboy1900&quot;&gt;/u/blondeboy1900&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://np.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/5ct8xf/i_find_myself_visiting_this_sub_quite_therapeutic/d9z85zt&quot;&gt;Antinatalists respond to the question, &amp;#39;Why wouldn&amp;#39;t you commit suicide?&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;• Is antinatalism an inherently misanthropic philosophy?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No. Antinatalism is the philosophical study of the values involving birth and similar derivatives. Misanthropy is a dislike or disgust of man and/or mankind. On the contrary, many antinatalists are philanthropists to the extent that they would not wish to impose cruel life experiences on humans who would otherwise &amp;quot;come to be&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As always,please do not forget to read the rules on the sidebar and the wiki (particularly &lt;a href=&quot;/u/textingperosn&quot;&gt;u/textingperosn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s Antinatalism guide) so we all can have a civil and informed discussion with each other.

A simplified explanation would be that a lack of pain is given an arbitrary positive value while a lack is pleasure is given a value of 0, and suffering is anything that makes your life bad while pleasure is anything that makes your life good. But, that would imply that a life completely devoid of pain and pleasure is somehow positive or good.

Maybe the answer is any intelligent species reaches a AN point of view and therefore we don’t have to worry and hold out, let’s adopt AN now and reduce the amount of suffering endured, since it’ll most likely take more suffering in the long run to find out if a multiverse or multidimensional beings exist (if they exist at all, I’m not well versed on those subjects), and somehow inform them of this viewpoint.

(The moral angle is not particularly interesting to me, only feasibility. That said I can see where you&amp;#39;re coming from, although Benatar&amp;#39;s stuff seems to be intellectually puerile, escapist and confused in the way Pearce&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hedweb.com/&quot;&gt;hedonistic imperative&lt;/a&gt; is not). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way you advocate antinatalism, it appears to spread by simple proselytism and guide people to nothing more than to voluntarily relinquish breeding. The only winning condition for you, then, is convincing everyone at once, or such a substantial majority of humans so as to cause civilizational collapse, to just permanently lose the will to procreate.&lt;br/&gt; But if you fail to persuade the Amish or some such extremely natalist group (and btw, good luck with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timesofisrael.com/demography-democracy-and-delusions/&quot;&gt;Ultra-Orthodox Jews&lt;/a&gt;, they can&amp;#39;t read you and their book is very straightforward on the value of populating the universe), or even isolated breeder fanatics, the game continues.&lt;br/&gt; And in fact &lt;strong&gt;it gets much worse for you, philosophically speaking,&lt;/strong&gt; because now every human who was remotely open to your arguments and every cultural tradition that allowed these arguments to spread is gone; the surviving population is extremely pain tolerant and people go &amp;quot;eh, a lifetime of misery, meh, works for me and my 12 children&amp;quot; even when dying from advanced cancer. While the degree of genetic predisposition to breed is debatable, some component &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513817302799&quot;&gt;is sure to be there&lt;/a&gt;, and as for culture, you know the fate of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers&quot;&gt;Shakers&lt;/a&gt; well enough. Thus, all you do is impose a selection pressure towards natalism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, it seems to me that actual minimization of suffering is best achieved by convincing people to 1) breed less for the time being 2) engineer future generations to be verifiably suffering-proof 3) somehow tie this to fitness advantage so that the suffering breed of humans goes extinct (biosphere is more vulnerable in any case). Alternatively, you&amp;#39;d need to cause some sort of extinction event, e.g. by accelerating climate change to Venus scenario if possible, or provoking a super-pathogen pandemic or whatever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barring that, it seems like your project is bound to maximize the amount of suffering in the universe. How do you live with it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found the mention of &amp;quot;virtue-based ethics&amp;quot; in your FAQ.

(even if you can argue that many of these types were simply kids who didn&amp;#39;t know any better. Unfortunately,quite a few of them haven&amp;#39;t grown past the douchebag stage. and most commonly,they are those who likely have never gotten their just desserts.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a man with a rather &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/jnewny/as_much_as_i_hate_religion_and_generally_dislike/gb14ozv/&quot;&gt;unfortunate and violent&lt;/a&gt; past. A lot of people,particularly those who are rather deluded about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe3na9umxDA&quot;&gt;fighting capabilities&lt;/a&gt; (Not only do they have no training,but often no real experience with violence. yet they can make such conclusions),talk of ripping people a new asshole if anyone dared try to mess with them. The difference between me and them? I have actually &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt; it. Not just once,but multiple times in the past. There&amp;#39;s a huge difference between thinking you can do something and actually being able to do it. I&amp;#39;ve crossed that &amp;quot;hypothetical.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;and to tell you all the truth...I&amp;#39;m not particularly regretful about the things I did. In fact,I&amp;#39;m rather proud of it. There are many former bully victims who regret never standing up to their bullies as a child,and it haunts them later into adulthood. (I&amp;#39;ve spoken to a few online) Now,I will say that out of sheer luck,I have never caused anyone permanent physical damage. Had I done so,maybe I would be singing a different &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/costknife.htm&quot;&gt;tune&lt;/a&gt; right now. But case in point,I have hurt people,and firmly believe they deserved it. Even if they changed into becoming better people later on. (which you can argue that their encounter with me might have played a not-insignificant role. Sadly,most are still Natalists however...)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I want to ask is...Do you think I&amp;#39;m a hypocrite? For subscribing to Antinatalism,a philosophy that does its best to spare everyone pain and suffering,yet not being regretful about the assholes I&amp;#39;ve hurt in the past,just because I believe they deserved it and it was for my own wellbeing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many martial artists react to my story range from silent approval to angry indignation. Ironically,despite training in something that is,at its core,about hurting other human beings,many believe in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/violentsolution.htm&quot;&gt;Violence is never the answer&lt;/a&gt; cliche that I,and many who have actual experience with violent assholes/bullies,agree to be pure horseshit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I want to know what the community here thinks? Are you one of those who subscribe to the above cliche? I honestly would not expect such naivety from anyone here(we live in a world full of &amp;quot;necessary evils.&amp;quot;),but who knows. Please give me your honest answer.

Can you argue for the possibility of voluntarily eliminating the only source of consciousness from the World, leaving it just a drifting hot and cold rocks?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you want for human race to go extinct?
