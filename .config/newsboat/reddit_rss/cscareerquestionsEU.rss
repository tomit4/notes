I love what I do but the problem I found is that I am getting massively underpaid. The company is relatively new so they don&amp;#39;t have a budget to fund the employees atm and I understand that but it&amp;#39;s also not helping me financially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the company culture, how they listen to every employee&amp;#39;s concern and make changes according to our feedback but again it&amp;#39;s the pay that&amp;#39;s making me a quite unhappy for what I can do in my current tech stack, how much work I put in, how much the management understands the difficulties that arise with this particular tech / framework and how much I&amp;#39;ve really put into this for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I applied for other well established companies via a recruiter and I got an offer just 2 days ago after months of multiple interview and technical test processes. They&amp;#39;re offering me 10k more than what I&amp;#39;m earning currently. They&amp;#39;re saying if I accept it right now and stop talking to other companies, they&amp;#39;ll offer me 10k from the start or if I take my time in accepting the offer, it&amp;#39;ll first be 6k during my probation period and 10k after. Which in itself seems quite &amp;quot;different&amp;quot; as the way I see it, it should be the full amount regardless. But I may be wrong with this so please correct me if that&amp;#39;s a common practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now this is alarming as I&amp;#39;ve asked the recruiter to let me have a think about this for at least a week because this is a big life changing decision. I am literally going to be changing cities to live and work from there for the long term and this will mean a lot of changes in my personal life and it is a big decision. I also want to think it over about smaller things like making sure I&amp;#39;ll be okay with the company culture change as like I said it&amp;#39;s going to be a long term employment and other personal life changes that comes with this big move.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve not been able to keep in contact with the company directly and the recruiter has started to call me daily and email me multiple times a day about the pressure of that extra money if I accept it right now and wants an answer by the next 4 days max. Which I think is absurd as to how can I make this world turning decision in just the span of 3 days and if this is the correct way of pressuring a candidate into accepting an offer? The recruiter says it&amp;#39;s because the company is really excited to have me and it&amp;#39;s also good for that extra money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This raises a few questions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the company is that eager to make me accept an offer that they go to tactics to give me the full money if I accept it right now and if they need manpower that desperately, doesn&amp;#39;t that come as a red flag as it could be because people are leaving their company so often they need new employees RIGHT NOW.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is it really the company that&amp;#39;s pushing me to making these decisions within a spawn of mere days or the recruiter pushing to get their pay check? If it the latter, should I directly get in contact with the company and ask them if I can get at least a week to think this through because I can&amp;#39;t make this decision this harshly.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t like how they&amp;#39;re pushing me, I may just decline it.

I work as a Back End Developer in an SME IT consulting company. I&amp;#39;ve been contacted twice on LinkedIn by a major Italian IT Consulting firm through recruiters living and working abroad (Switzerland, Uk), speaking in English but offering jobs in-office (not remote) in the main city area. To clarify: not abroad. Office locations were in the biggest city near where I live. They were also looking for people with an active VAT Code (Partita IVA in Italy), which I know is required when working for a foreign Company, but as I said, the company is based in Italy, and they also have an office in this city (although there are other offices in Italy and outside the country).&lt;br/&gt; I think it&amp;#39;s weird. Is this a new trend in Italy or in other EU countries with relatively high labor costs? Are they trying to employ human resources through their offices outside the country in order to benefit from lower taxes and lower labor costs and to bypass annoying Italian &amp;quot;CCNLs&amp;quot; (nationally regulated labor contracts)? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;m just curious about the reason to operate in such a way.

I’m enjoying it well enough but I’ve started to realise I enjoy the software side of it much more than the rest. I have no trouble enjoyment wise continuing the degree, but I have questioned whether I should switch to computer science. My uni would let me, but I would have to repeat my first year. Cant decide if it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a fairly diverse degree, and there’s plenty of opportunity to do more software and programming in the later years, but at the end I will nonetheless have a BEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and I’m sure will be under qualified for many engineer jobs. But can that be made up by independent learning and/or a masters degree?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just looking for any advice people have to make my decision. If I am to switch, I need to let my uni know sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks xx&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/stressyanddepressy03&quot;&gt; /u/stressyanddepressy03 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m709r/electrical_engineering_to_software_engineering_uk/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m709r/electrical_engineering_to_software_engineering_uk/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10m709r</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m709r/electrical_engineering_to_software_engineering_uk/" /><updated>2023-01-27T00:17:53+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-27T00:17:53+00:00</published><title>Electrical engineering to software engineering?

Of course, tech has fields which are very different from, and harder than, HTML, but I&amp;#39;ll cross those bridges when I get to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, now I&amp;#39;m having trouble pinning down what specific things would be best to learn. Hence, I&amp;#39;d appreciate if anyone could advise me about this, as well as point me to some good learning resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web development, software development and the cloud are areas that look interesting from what research I&amp;#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, please direct me to any other good fields, e.g. which have the best earning potential &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;#39;d prefer a remote role, but if I had to be based somewhere, I&amp;#39;d choose Glasgow, for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/mok2k11&quot;&gt; /u/mok2k11 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m0j7v/uk_im_looking_for_advice_on_how_to_selflearn_and/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m0j7v/uk_im_looking_for_advice_on_how_to_selflearn_and/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10m0j7v</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/10m0j7v/uk_im_looking_for_advice_on_how_to_selflearn_and/" /><updated>2023-01-26T19:43:27+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-26T19:43:27+00:00</published><title>UK: I'm looking for advice on how to self-learn and then get into tech</title></entry></feed>
