He does what he does with little care to what people think because he trusts his own decisions since he knows how smart he is. Morty doesn&amp;#39;t get to have that, so he&amp;#39;s understandably a lot more nervous and filled with self-doubt especially in alien situations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we do see Rick have those moments of doubt. He&amp;#39;s extremely self-conscious of his mistakes, even mindwiping Morty over some. He has very low self-esteem and stutters a lot even when he&amp;#39;s sober. When he makes the right choice, he&amp;#39;s his normal self, but when he makes mistakes, he lashes out or breaks down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, while &lt;strong&gt;Morty&lt;/strong&gt; is still very anxious and unsure of himself, he&amp;#39;s made huge leaps and bounds in becoming more confident and competent. Morty has even portrayed some Rick-like tendencies and actions, now that he&amp;#39;s experienced enough to have a reason to be sure of himself too. People say that with being &amp;quot;smart,&amp;quot; part of it is intelligence, and the other part is cleverness. I think our Morty has always had Rick&amp;#39;s cleverness but it was just smothered under his self-doubts. I think Morty actually being pretty sharp has only become more and more prominent as he develops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Detoxified Rick, Rickbot, and Doofus Rick (though he&amp;#39;s from another universe, so may not be applicable) also show that side of Rick that occasionally comes out that really does feel just like a more experienced, matured Morty. I feel like in many cases, it&amp;#39;s Rick&amp;#39;s intelligence that drives him to act like a narcissistic asshole, but in cases where that narcissism is suppressed, it&amp;#39;s a lot more apparent how his base personality may not be so different from Morty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started thinking about this mainly after rewatching the &lt;strong&gt;Morty&amp;#39;s Mindblowers&lt;/strong&gt; episode, where I noticed that after losing their memories, Morty lost his stutter, but Rick&amp;#39;s was much more prominent. In &lt;strong&gt;ABCs of Beth,&lt;/strong&gt; there&amp;#39;s also that segment where Rick makes a joke that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense, but he decides to stick with it after some self-talk. I could easily see Morty in the same shoes by Season 6. Also, while part of it is just that they spend so much time together and are written on the same show, Rick and Morty also have a ton of overlap in speech patterns and semantics, especially compared to the rest of the family. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, a lot of Morty&amp;#39;s actual anxiety and self-doubting tendencies were probably passed down by Rick, as opposed to always blaming all of that on &lt;strong&gt;Jerry&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; genetics, who also doesn&amp;#39;t actually stutter that much. I feel like Morty is both clever and intelligent, with an emphasis on the clever, and the opposite for &lt;strong&gt;Summer.&lt;/strong&gt; I somewhat feel that a trait of Jerry&amp;#39;s that was passed down could actually be his resilience. Rick and &lt;strong&gt;Beth&lt;/strong&gt; sometimes seem to fall apart harder than anyone else, other than Morty in the earliest seasons. Even if Jerry falls apart every other day, he&amp;#39;s always able to put himself back together, like Summer. Rick seems to stay broken, a bit more like Morty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/OptimusTardis&quot;&gt; /u/OptimusTardis &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/10aaqa0/without_the_confidence_boost_from_his/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/10aaqa0/without_the_confidence_boost_from_his/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_10aaqa0</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/10aaqa0/without_the_confidence_boost_from_his/" /><updated>2023-01-12T21:07:01+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-12T21:07:01+00:00</published><title>Without the confidence boost from his intelligence, I think Rick's personality would be much closer to Morty's</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/overinlove</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/overinlove</uri></author><category term="c137" label="r/c137"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a few posts saying this more or less&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/overinlove&quot;&gt; /u/overinlove &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/108ial0/wherewhen_does_it_mention_or_imply_that_rick/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/108ial0/wherewhen_does_it_mention_or_imply_that_rick/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_108ial0</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/c137/comments/108ial0/wherewhen_does_it_mention_or_imply_that_rick/" /><updated>2023-01-10T19:20:54+00:00</updated><published>2023-01-10T19:20:54+00:00</published><title>Where/when does it mention or imply that Rick Prime was the first to invent interdimensional?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/KevinWidiyaratne</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/KevinWidiyaratne</uri></author><category term="c137" label="r/c137"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Beth is alive in all the other dimensions, where is Diane?
