Sometimes some of it actually makes it onto a page in something resembling art. This is a good thing, as it has enabled him to keep his job at Wētā Workshop for close to 20 years (although he swears he&amp;#39;s not that old). Sometimes they even let him do things with computers, which taste less delicious but make some pretty good art, nonetheless. Some of the stuff that he&amp;#39;s shaken out of the keyboard over the years has included animation, film props, concept design and even some sculptures- which explains why the keys don’t work very well anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artstation.com/slambert&quot;&gt;https://www.artstation.com/slambert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael McDonald&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Director, Walker Labs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up in the back of a van in New Zealand, Michael never had a clear path to land a dream job in the video game industry. But he hustled. Hard. He received countless rejection letters, bounced between countries on a shoestring budget, and even crashed a VIP industry party to get his portfolio in the right hands. Eventually, his determination paid off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With over 15 years of experience in the gaming world, Michael has worked at some of the top studios around, including Ubisoft, Wētā Workshop, and EA. He&amp;#39;s contributed to some of the most popular gaming franchises out there, like The Sims, Need For Speed, Mass Effect, and the upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. As the Creative Director at Walker Labs, he&amp;#39;s now leading a talented team towards revolutionising gaming as we know it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.michael-mcdonald.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.michael-mcdonald.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmprofile&quot;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmprofile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;—--&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diana Diriwaechter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Lead, Epic Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diana is an artist, educator and CG specialist with over 25 years of industry experience.

This includes such titles as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and its sequel Modern Warfare 2, Tony Hawk&amp;#39;s Pro Skater: Underground, Titanfall, where he was Lead Environment Artist, and its critically acclaimed follow-up Titanfall 2, where he was Environment Art Director. Most recently, Todd was the Art Director for Respawn&amp;#39;s meteoric success, Apex Legends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Todd&amp;#39;s early passions were architecture and video games. His career path as an environmental artist became clear when he realized he could make architecture without the constraints of physics and building codes, all while being surrounded by like minded gamers. As Art Director, Todd encourages his artists to think as &amp;quot;game developers first&amp;quot;, pushing for art that both looks and PLAYS awesome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/tsuenami_dev/&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/tsuenami_dev/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drew Morrison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent Illustrator, Author, and Publisher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew grew up in a creative environment, watching his Mom pull late nights as a commercial illustrator.
