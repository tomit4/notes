</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/crabs-all-way-down/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week we examine one of nature's most humble creations: crabs. Turns out when you look closely at these little scuttlers, things get surprisingly existential — about how to come into being, how to survive chaos, and how to live. We even examine the possibility of evolutionary destiny.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This ep is a two-parter, a double-decker crab cake of sorts. Served up on a bed of lettuce and beautiful weirdness. The first layer comes from producer Rachael Cusick, and is a story she told live on stage at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.popupmagazine.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pop-Up Magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span&gt;http://www.popupmagazine.com)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; as a part of their Fall of 2022 tour. It chronicles a cross-species love story between artist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://maryakers.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mary Akers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (http://maryakers.com/) and an overlooked pet store companion, a  creature that even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/ctudge.cfm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chris Tudge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (https://zpr.io/MyUNwPAaqewg)&lt;span&gt; — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; scientist dedicated to this creature, you could say — could not get a ring on. The second layer is cooked up by Lulu, who tries to understand why crabs keep evolving (according to recent work by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://oeb.harvard.edu/people/joanna-wolfe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jo Wolfe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (https://zpr.io/2GftY9RjbLkF)&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/profiles/bracken-grissom-heather.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heather Bracken-Grissom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (https://zpr.io/HhvMVfnThp5P)&lt;span&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.museum.zoo.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-javier-luque-senior-research-associate-invertebrates"&gt;Javier Luque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (https://zpr.io/xBiQHEtNSKZr)&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/trust-engineers-2302/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First aired in 2015, this is an episode about social media, and how, when we talk online, things can quickly go south. But do they have to? In the earlier days of Facebook, we met with a group of social engineers who were convinced that tiny changes in wording can make the online world a kinder, gentler place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We just have to  agree to be their lab rats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because Facebook, or something like it, is where we share and like and gossip and gripe. And before we were as aware of its impact, Facebook had a laboratory of human behavior the likes of which we’d never seen. We got to peek into the work of Arturo Bejar and a team of researchers who were tweaking our online experience, to try to make the world a better place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even now, just under a decade later, we’re still left wondering if that’s possible, or even a good idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/golden-goose/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After years of being publicly shamed for “fleecing” the taxpayers with their frivolous and obscure studies, scientists decided to hit back with  … an awards show?! This episode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we gate-crash the Grammys of government-funded research, a.k.a. the Golden Goose Awards. The twist of these awards is that they go to scientific research that at first sounds trivial or laughable but then turns out to change the world. We tell the story of one of the latest winners: a lonely Filipino boy who picked up an ice cream cone that was actually a covert vampire assassin. Decades later, that discovery leads to an even bigger one: an entire pharmacy's worth of new drugs hidden just below the surface of the ocean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Decades later, that discovery leads to an even bigger one: an entire pharmacy's worth of new drugs hidden just below the surface of the ocean. EPISODE CREDITS: Reported by - Latif Nasser and Maria Paz Gutierrez with help from - Ekedi Fausther-Keeys Produced by - Maria Paz Gutierrez and Matt Kielty with help from Ekedi Fausther-Keeys Original music and sound design contributed by Matt Kielty with mixing help from Arianne Wack. Fact-checking by Emily Krieger Editing by Soren Wheeler who thought the whole episode should have been a little shorter.  Special thanks to Erin Heath, Haylie Swenson, Gwendolyn Bogard, Valeria Sabate and everyone else at AAAS who oversee the Golden Goose Awards. Also to Maggie Luddy, and former Congressman Jim Cooper, Terry Lee Merritt at University of Utah, Jim Tranquada, John McCormack, and the Cosman Shell Collection at Occidental College.   CITATIONS: Videos - Gorgeous slo mo video of cone snails hunting (https://zpr.io/uiWrS3J2BuZM).

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bliss-2302/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this deep cut from 2012, we are searching for platonic ideals longing for completion, engaged in epic quests for holy grails in science, linguistics, and world peace. And along the way, we’ll meet the dreamers and measure just how impossible their dreams are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First: a perfect moment. On day 86 of a 3-month trek to and from the South Pole, adventurer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aleksandergamme/?hl=en"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aleksander Gamme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://zpr.io/ryaJzt5vaNTZ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://zpr.io/ryaJzt5vaNTZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) discovered something he'd stashed under the ice at the start of his trip. He wasn't expecting such a rush of happiness in that cold, hungry instant, but he hit the bliss jackpot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Producer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/people/tim-howard/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim Howard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://zpr.io/bfxEEMYHf5vT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://zpr.io/bfxEEMYHf5vT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) brings us the incredible and tragic story of Charles Bliss -- the man that inspired this show. As Charles's friend Richard Ure and writer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://arikaokrent.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arika Okrent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://zpr.io/3gjsdSePpQbG"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://zpr.io/3gjsdSePpQbG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) explain, Bliss believed that war was often caused by the misuse of language. Having lived through the hell of Nazi concentration camps, he set about creating the perfect language, based on symbols and logic. Years later, Shirley McNaughton accidentally discovered it, and started using it to communicate with her students -- kids with cerebral palsy who quickly picked up the language and made it their own. At first, Charles was thrilled...until he started to feel his original dream of saving the world was slipping from his fingers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, co-host &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/people/latif-nasser"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif Nasser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://zpr.io/pJsnQSYWJLTe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;https://zpr.io/pJsnQSYWJLTe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) explains how, on a cold, snowy farm in Vermont in 1880, a kid named Wilson Bentley put a snowflake under a microscope and started a lifelong quest to capture perfection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Producer Tim Howard (https://zpr.io/bfxEEMYHf5vT) brings us the incredible and tragic story of Charles Bliss -- the man that inspired this show. As Charles's friend Richard Ure and writer Arika Okrent (https://zpr.io/3gjsdSePpQbG) explain, Bliss believed that war was often caused by the misuse of language. Having lived through the hell of Nazi concentration camps, he set about creating the perfect language, based on symbols and logic. Years later, Shirley McNaughton accidentally discovered it, and started using it to communicate with her students -- kids with cerebral palsy who quickly picked up the language and made it their own. At first, Charles was thrilled...until he started to feel his original dream of saving the world was slipping from his fingers. And finally, co-host Latif Nasser (https://zpr.io/pJsnQSYWJLTe) explains how, on a cold, snowy farm in Vermont in 1880, a kid named Wilson Bentley put a snowflake under a microscope and started a lifelong quest to capture perfection.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/ukraine-handoff/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We continue the story of a covert s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;muggling operation to bring abortion pills into Ukraine, shortly after the Russian invasion. In this episode, reporters Katz Laszlo and Gregory Warner go to Ukraine, landing on a fall night during a citywide blackout, to pick up the trail of the pills and find out about the doctors and patients who needed them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But as they follow the pills around the country, what they learn changes their understanding of how we talk about these pills, and how we talk about choice, in a war. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode is the second of two done in collaboration with NPR’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rough Translation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/birthstory-2301/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You know the drill — all it takes is one sperm, one egg, and blammo — you’ve got yourself a baby. Right? Well, in this 2015 episode, conception takes on a new form — it’s the sperm and the egg, plus: two wombs, four countries, and money. Lots of money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the story of an Israeli couple, two men, who go to another continent to get themselves a baby — three, in fact — by hiring surrogates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to carry the children for them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As we follow them on their journey, an earth-shaking revelation shifts our focus from them to the surrogate mothers. Unfolding in real time, as countries around the world considered bans on surrogacy, this episode looked at a relationship that manages to feel deeply affecting and deeply uncomfortable at the same time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Birthstory” is a collaboration with the brilliant radio show and podcast &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Israel Story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, created to tell stories for, and about, Israel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://israelstory.org/en/episodes/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go check ‘em out!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tal and Air had a chance to meet each surrogate once - just after the deliveries, after all the paperwork was sorted out, and before any one left Nepal. As Amir says, they wanted to say "a big thank you." These meetings between intended parents, surrogate, and new babies are a traditional part of the surrogacy process in India and Nepal, and we heard reports from the surrogates that they also look forward to them. These moments do not stigmatize, reveal the identity of, or endanger the surrogates. Tal and Amir provided the audio for this web extra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/games-2301/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, first aired in 2011, we talk about the meaning of a good game — whether it's a pro football playoff, or a family showdown on the kitchen table. And how some games can make you feel, at least for a little while, like your whole life hangs in the balance. This hour of Radiolab, Jad and Robert wonder why we get so invested in something so trivial. What is it about games that make them feel so pivotal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hear how a recurring dream about football turned into a real-life lesson for Stephen Dubner, we watch a chessboard turn into a playground where by-the-book moves give way to totally unpredictable possibilities, and we talk to Dan Engber, a one time senior editor at Slate, now at The Atlantic, and a bunch of scientists about why betting on a longshot is so much fun. And finally, we talk to Malcolm Gladwell about why he loves the overdog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/universe-verse/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For a special New Year’s treat, we take a tour through the history of the universe with the help of… poets. Our guide is Maria Popova, who writes the popular blog The Marginalian (formerly Brain Pickings), and the poetry is from her project, “The Universe in Verse” — an annual event where poets read poems about science, space, and the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to all of our poets, musicians, and performers: Marie Howe, Tracy K. Smith, Rebecca Elson, Joan As Police Woman, Patti Smith, Gautam Srikishan, Zoe Keating, and Emily Dickinson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/new-normal-2212/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode —first released in 2009 and then again in 2015, with an update — asks, what is “normal”? Maybe it exists, maybe not. We examine peace-loving baboons with Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky, talk to Stu Rasmussen, whose preferred pronouns were he/him (https://zpr.io/nUdsZawNmhwt), and his neighbors in Silverton, Oregon about how a town chooses its community over outsider opinions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should a juror be able to ignore the law?

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/middle-everything-ever/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After graduating from high school, without a clear plan for what to do next, Laura Andrews started asking herself a lot of questions. A spiral of big philosophical thoughts that led her to sit down and write to us with a question that was… oddly mathematical.  What is the most average size thing, if you take into account everything in the universe. So, along with mathematician Steven Strogatz, we decided to see if we could sit down and, in a friendly throwdown of guesstimates and quick calculations, rough out an answer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/ashes-lawn-2212/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A global pandemic. Thousands dying. A passive government. An afflicted group fueled by grief and anger. In this episode, first aired in 2020, Reporter Tracie Hunte wanted to understand this moment of pain and confusion. As she looked back three decades, she found a complicated answer to a simple question: when nothing seems to work, how do you make change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special thanks to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-perfect-political-thicket-2211/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren was asked at the end of his career, “What was the most important case of your tenure?”, there were a lot of answers he could have given. He had presided over some of the most important decisions in the court’s history — cases that dealt with segregation in schools, the right to an attorney, the right to remain silent, just to name a few. But his answer was a surprise: he said “Baker v. Carr,” a 1962 redistricting case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On this 2016 episode, part of our series &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;More Perfect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, we talk about why this case was so important. Important enough that it pushed one Supreme Court justice to a nervous breakdown, brought a boiling feud to a head, gave another justice a stroke, and changed the course of the Supreme Court — and the nation — forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode is the one of the few times you can hear the voice of our Executive Producer Suzie Lechtenberg. After years of leading the team, Suzie will leave WNYC to start her new adventure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suzie: re-publishing this episode is our way of saying thank you for all you’ve done — for the show and for each of us.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/butt-stuff/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we have a butt? Well, it’s not just for the convenience of a portable seat cushion. This week, we have a conversation with our Contributing Editor Heather Radke, who has spent the last several years going deep on one of our most noticeable surface features. She’s been working on a book called &lt;em&gt;Butts, a Backstory&lt;/em&gt; and in this episode, she tells us about a fascinating history she uncovered that takes us from a eugenicist’s attempt in the late 1930s to concretize the most average human, to the rise of the garment industry, and the pain and shame we often feel today when we go looking for a pair of pants that actually fit.&lt;/p&gt;

Talk with writer Frederick Kaufman about our first peek into the wonderful world of human digestion that came about thanks to a hunting accident.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/weather-report/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meteorologists are as common as the clouds these days. Rolling onto the airwaves at morning, noon and night they tell us what to wear and where to plan our picnics. They’re local celebrities with an outsized influence. But in the 1940s, there was really only one of them: Irving P. Krick. He was suave and dapper, with the charm of a sunbeam and the boldness of a thunderclap. He was a salesman who turned the weather into a product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, listen to the story of Krick and his descendants, a crew of profit prophets who have found fame and fortune staring at the sky and seeing the future. We follow them from the bloody beaches of World War II to the climate changed coasts of today, exploring their impact and predicting what they’ll mean in our wackier weather world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Thanks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special thanks to Xandra Clark, Homa Sarabi, Santi Dharmawan, Francisco Alvarez, Maureen O’Leary and everyone at NOAA, Shimon Elkabetz, Jack Neff, Joe Pennington, Brad Colman, Morgan Yarker, Megan Walker, Eric Bramford, Jay Cohen and Irving Krick Jr for supplying us with tons of great archival footage and audio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious to know more about the history of weather forecasting, go check out Kris Harper’s book &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262517355/weather-by-the-numbers/"&gt;Weather by the Numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also asked Illustrator and Animator &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sophiatwigt/"&gt;Sophia Twigt&lt;/a&gt; to make a little video explaining how the U.S. government agency NOAA collects and treats weather data to make weather forecasts. Here it is, narrated by Simon Adler. We hope you enjoy it:&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/black-box-2210/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, first aired in 2014, we examine three very different kinds of black boxes — spaces where we know what’s going in, we know what’s coming out, but can’t see what happens in that in-between space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the darkest parts of metamorphosis to a sixty-year-old secret among magicians, and the nature of consciousness itself, we shine some light on three questions. But for each, we contend with an answerless space, leaving just enough room for the mystery and magic… always wondering what’s inside the Black Box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/no-touch-abortion/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the Dobbs decision went down, ER doctor Avir Mitra started to prepare for the worst — botched, at-home abortions that would land pregnant people in the emergency room. To prepare himself and his colleagues for the patients they might see, and to think through how best to treat them, Avir asked Laura MacIsaac, one of New York City’s leading gynecologists and abortion experts, to come talk to his ER department. But what Dr. MacIsaac had to say in her lecture wasn’t what Avir expected: she didn’t talk about how we’re going back in time and the horrors of self-harm as a means to an abortion. Instead, she painted a picture of progress — how in the last 40 years, through private practice and clinical trials all around the world, the process and science of providing and having an abortion has changed dramatically, mostly because of two types of pills: misoprostol and mifepristone. On this episode, Avir and Senior Correspondent Molly Webster visit Dr. MacIsaac to hear more, and also learn about a new study that indicates the process of abortion is on the precipice of even further change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To prepare himself and his colleagues for the patients they might see, and to think through how best to treat them, Avir asked Laura MacIsaac, one of New York City’s leading gynecologists and abortion experts, to come talk to his ER department. But what Dr. MacIsaac had to say in her lecture wasn’t what Avir expected: she didn’t talk about how we’re going back in time and the horrors of self-harm as a means to an abortion. Instead, she painted a picture of progress — how in the last 40 years, through private practice and clinical trials all around the world, the process and science of providing and having an abortion has changed dramatically, mostly because of two types of pills: misoprostol and mifepristone. On this episode, Avir and Senior Correspondent Molly Webster visit Dr. MacIsaac to hear more, and also learn about a new study that indicates the process of abortion is on the precipice of even further change. </p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/the-theater-of-david-byrnes-mind/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It all started when the rockstar David Byrne did a Freaky-Friday-like body-swap with a Barbie Doll. That’s what inspired him — along with his collaborator Mala Gaonkar — to transform a 15,000 square-foot warehouse in Denver, Colorado into a brainy funhouse known as the &lt;em&gt;Theater of the Mind&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode, co-Host Latif Nasser moderates a live conversation between Byrne and Neuroscientist Thalia Wheatley at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. The trio talk about how we don’t see what we think we see, don’t hear what we think we hear, and don’t know what we think we know, but also how all that… might actually be a good thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Charlie Miller and everyone else at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, Emily Simoness and everyone else at the Arbutus Foundation, Boen Wang, and Heather Radke. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/playing-god-2209/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When people are dying and you can only save some, how do you choose? Maybe you save the youngest. Or the sickest. Maybe you even just put all the names in a hat and pick at random. Would your answer change if a sick person was right in front of you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, first aired back in 2016, we follow &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; reporter Sheri Fink as she searches for the answer. In a warzone, a hurricane, a church basement, and an earthquake, the question remains the same. What happens, what should happen, when humans are forced to play God?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very special thanks to Lilly Sullivan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All kids: hers, yours, and the one still living inside us all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab for Kids Presents: Terrestrials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And it’s spellbinding. So much so, that we wanted to put this audio goodness in front of as many ears as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which is why we’re running the first episode of that series here for you today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s called The Mastermind. In it, Sy Montgomery, an author and naturalist, shares the story of a color-changing creature many people assumed to be brainless who outsmarts his human captors. If you want a SPOILER of what the creature is, read on: It’s an octopus. We hear the story of one particularly devious octopus who lost a limb, was captured by humans, and then managed to make an escape from its aquarium tank—back into the ocean! The tale of “Inky” the octopus calls into question who we think of as intelligent (and kissable) in the animal kingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/quicksaaaand-2209/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For many of us, quicksand was once a real fear — it held a vise grip on our imaginations, from childish sandbox games to grown-up anxieties about venturing into unknown lands. But these days, quicksand can't even scare an 8-year-old. In this short, we try to find out why. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then-Producer Soren Wheeler introduces us to Dan Engber, writer and columnist for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Slate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, now with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Dan became obsessed with quicksand after happening upon a strange fact: kids are no longer afraid of it. In this episode, Dan recounts for Soren and Robert Krulwich the story of his obsession. He immersed himself in research, compiled mountains of data, met with quicksand fetishists and, in the end, formulated a theory about why the terror of his childhood seems to have lost its menacing allure. Then Carlton Cuse, who at the time we first aired this episode was best-known as the writer and executive producer of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, helps us think about whether giant pits of hero-swallowing mud might one day creep back into the spotlight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, as this episode first aired in 2013, we can see if we were right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode Credits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Reported and produced by Soren Wheeler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Death
</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rodney-v-death-2209/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the fall of 2004, Jeanna Giese checked into the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin with a set of puzzling symptoms... and her condition was deteriorating fast. By the time Dr. Rodney Willoughby saw her, he only knew one thing for sure: if Jeanna's disturbing breakdown turned out to be rabies, she was doomed to die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happened next seemed like a medical impossibility. In this episode, originally aired in 2013, Producer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/people/tim-howard/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim Howard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells Jeanna's story and talks to authors Monica Murphy and Bill Wasik, and scientists Amy Gilbert and Sergio Recuenco, while trying to unravel the mystery of an unusual patient and the doctor who dared to take on certain death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/9-volt-nirvana-2208/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learn a new language faster than ever! Leave doubt in the dust! Be a better sniper! Could you do all that and more with just a zap to the noggin? Maybe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in the early 2010s, Sally Adee, then an editor at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;New Scientist Magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, went to a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) conference and heard about a way to speed up learning with something called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple of years later, Sally found herself wielding an M4 assault rifle to pick off simulated enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. But that got then-producer Soren Wheeler thinking about this burgeoning world of electroceuticals, and if real, what limits will it reach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this episode, first aired back in 2014, we brought in Michael Weisend, then a neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, to tell us how it works (Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). And sat down with Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz, then at the University of British Columbia, to help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to a circuit board and a soldering iron, can make their own brain zapper. And then checked-in again to hear about the unexpected after-effects a day of super-charged sniper training can have on one mild-mannered science journalist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode credits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Leave doubt in the dust! Be a better sniper! Could you do all that and more with just a zap to the noggin? Maybe.</p>
<p>Back in the early 2010s, Sally Adee, then an editor at <em>New Scientist Magazine</em>, went to a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) conference and heard about a way to speed up learning with something called trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A couple of years later, Sally found herself wielding an M4 assault rifle to pick off simulated enemy combatants with a battery wired to her temple. But that got then-producer Soren Wheeler thinking about this burgeoning world of electroceuticals, and if real, what limits will it reach.</p>
<p>For this episode, first aired back in 2014, we brought in Michael Weisend, then a neuroscientist at Wright State Research Institute, to tell us how it works (Bonus: you get to hear Jad get his brain zapped). And sat down with Peter Reiner and Nick Fitz, then at the University of British Columbia, to help us think through the consequences of a world where anyone with 20 dollars and access to a circuit board and a soldering iron, can make their own brain zapper. And then checked-in again to hear about the unexpected after-effects a day of super-charged sniper training can have on one mild-mannered science journalist.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An all-star lineup of producers — Pat Walters, Lynn Levy, and Sean Cole — bring you stories about traps, getaways, perpetual cycles, and staggering breakthroughs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We kick things off with a true escape artist — a man who’s broken out of jail more times than anyone alive. Why does he keep running... and will he ever stop? Next, the ingeniously simple question that led Isaac Newton to an enormous intellectual breakthrough: why doesn’t the moon fall out of the sky? In the wake of Newton's new idea, we find ourselves in a strange space at the edge of the solar system, about to cross a boundary beyond which we know nothing. Finally, we hear the story of a blind kid who freed himself from an unhappy childhood by climbing into the telephone system, and bending it to his will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now sit back, relax and enjoy what we hope will prove to be a welcomed Escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode Credits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reported and produced by Pat Walters, Lynn Levy, and Sean Cole&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/humpback-and-killer/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Killer whales — orcas — eat all sorts of animals, including humpback calves. But one day, biologists saw a group of humpback whales trying to stop some killer whales from eating… a seal. And then it happened again. And again. It turns out, all across the oceans, humpback whales are swimming around stopping killer whales from hunting all kinds of animals — from seals to gray whales to sunfish. And of course while many scientists explain this behavior as the result of blind instincts that are ultimately selfish, much of the world celebrates humpbacks as superhero vigilantes of the sea. But when Annie McEwen dug into what was really going on between humpbacks and killer whales, she found a set of stories that refused to fit in either of those two ways of seeing the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Eric J.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/gatekeeper/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, Reporter Peter Smith and Senior Producer Matt Kielty tell the story of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that set the standard for scientific expertise in a courtroom, i.e., whether an expert can testify in a lawsuit. They also tell the story of the Daubert family — yes, the Dauberts of “Daubert v Merrell Dow” — whose win before the nine justices translated into a deeper loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Leah Litman, Rachel Rebouche, Jennifer Mnookin, David Savitz, Brooke Borel, and Tom Zeller Jr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporting by Peter Andrey Smith. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Produced by Matt Kielty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reporting and production assistance from Sarah Qari.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/baby-blue-blood-drive-2207/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is an episode that first aired in 2018 and then again in the thick of the pandemic in 2020. Why? Because though Horseshoe crabs are not much to look at, beneath their unassuming catcher’s-mitt shell, they harbor a half-billion-year-old secret: a superpower that helped them outlive the dinosaurs, survive all the Earth’s mass extinctions, and was essential in the development of the COVID vaccines.  And what is that secret superpower? Their blood. Their baby blue blood.  And it’s so miraculous that for decades, it hasn’t just been saving their butts, it’s been saving ours too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that all might be about to change.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Follow us as we follow these ancient critters - from a raunchy beach orgy to a marine blood drive to the most secluded waterslide - and learn a thing or two from them about how much we depend on nature and how much it depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/my-thymus-myself/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we go to a spot that may be one of the most philosophical places in the universe: the thymus, an organ that knows what is you, and what is not you. Its mood may be existential, but its role is practical — the thymus is the biological training ground where the body learns to protect itself from outside invaders (think: bacteria, coronaviruses). But this training is not the humdrum bit of science you might expect. It’s a magical shadowland with dire consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, we’ll leave the thymus to visit a team of doctors who are using this organ that protects &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; as a way to protect someone… else. Their work could change everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Thanks: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One thousand thanks to Hannah Meyer, Salomé Carcy, Josh Torres, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for showing us a real-life (mouse) thymus for this episode. Special thanks also go to Diane Mathis and Kate Webb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This one, which first aired in 2014, tells the strange story of a small group of islands that keeps us wondering: will our most sacred natural landscapes inevitably get swallowed up by humans? How far are we willing to go to stop that from happening?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This hour is about the Galápagos archipelago, which inspired Darwin’s theory of evolution and natural selection. Nearly 200 years later, the Galápagos are undergoing rapid changes that continue to pose — and perhaps answer — critical questions about the fragility and resilience of life on Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/no-special-duty-2206/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the massacre that took the lives of 19 schoolchildren in Uvalde, Texas, people across the world began to ask versions of one question: why did police wait outside the door instead of protecting the kids?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's not the first time this question has come up. Two years ago, as she watched police respond to the protests that followed the death of George Floyd, Producer B.A. Parker wondered: what are police &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;? With the help of our Producer Sarah Qari, she found that the United States’ Supreme Court had given this a most consequential and bewildering answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We decided to re-air this episode to shed light on how a case from 2005 upended our assumptions about the role police are meant to play in our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/neanderthals-revenge/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few months ago, co-Host Latif Nasser, who was otherwise healthy, saw blood in his poop. It was the start of a medical journey that made him not only question what was going on in his body, but also dig into the secret genetic story of how we became human. Curled up in a hospital bathroom, Latif tries to sort out whether his ordeal is the result of a long-lost sibling knifing him in the gut or, on the contrary, a long-forgotten kindness shared between two human-ish travelers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And, as one does upon passing a milestone, we’ve been looking back in all kinds of ways. Two weeks ago, we went out over the airwaves, “&lt;a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/radiolab-after-dark"&gt;Live on your FM dial&lt;/a&gt;,” a callback to our origins as a radio show. We revamped our logo and redid our website (get your Freq on, people!). More recently, Lulu's and Latif’s first stories came up in a meeting. They weren’t always the intrepid hosts of our collective journey in wonder. Soren Wheeler, our editor, thought it would be fun to highlight those firsts for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So here they are, baby Latif and Lulu, doing their darndest to make audio magic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We answered the phones, played some wonderfully weird audio, including one piece where Kurt Vonnegut—yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Kurt Vonnegut—interviews the dead, took part in some games and tomfoolery, and did everything we could to have and to share in our good time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/frailmales/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, we bring you two stories about little guys trying to do big big things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First, self-proclaimed animal grinch producer Becca Bressler introduces us to perhaps the one creature that has warmed her heart: a cricket. And more specifically, a male cricket. This is a tale about a tiny Romeo insect trying to find a mate, and the ingenious lengths he’ll go to have his beckoning heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image" style="max-width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://media.wnyc.org/i/660/742/l/80/2022/05/Frailmales_TreeCricket.JPG" alt=""&gt;
&lt;div class="image-metadata"&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;The hero of our story&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And second, producer Annie McEwen journeys through perhaps the zaniest game of football that has ever been played. When a ragtag group of players take on the top team, will it be an underdog tale for the ages or an absolute disaster?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special thanks to Stephen Spann and Joshua Baxter at the Doris and Harry Vice University Library at Cumberland University as well as Alison Reynolds at Georgia Tech Library. Thanks also to Rick Bell, and to Scott Larson who wrote a book all about this game called &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36549726-cumberland"&gt;Cumberland: The True Story of the Highest Scoring Football Game in History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And finally, thanks so much to our tape syncer Ambriehl Crutchfield for her help with this episode. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In competitive debate future presidents, supreme court justices, and titans of industry pummel each other with logic and rhetoric. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unclasp your briefcase. It’s time for a showdown. Looking back on an episode originally aired in 2016, we take a good long look at the world of competitive college debate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is Ryan Wash's story. He's a queer, Black, first-generation college student from Kansas City, Missouri who joined the debate team at Emporia State University on a whim. When he started going up against fast-talking, well-funded, “name-brand” teams, from places like Northwestern and Harvard, it was clear he wasn’t in Kansas anymore. So Ryan became the vanguard of a movement that made everything about debate debatable. In the end, he made himself a home in a strange and hostile land. Whether he was able to change what counts as rigorous academic argument … well, that’s still up for debate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Will Baker, Myra Milam, John Dellamore, Sam Mauer, Tiffany Dillard Knox, Mary Mudd, Darren "Chief" Elliot, Jodee Hobbs, Rashad Evans and Luke Hill. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Looking back on an episode originally aired in 2016, we take a good long look at the world of competitive college debate. This is Ryan Wash's story. He's a queer, Black, first-generation college student from Kansas City, Missouri who joined the debate team at Emporia State University on a whim. When he started going up against fast-talking, well-funded, “name-brand” teams, from places like Northwestern and Harvard, it was clear he wasn’t in Kansas anymore. So Ryan became the vanguard of a movement that made everything about debate debatable. In the end, he made himself a home in a strange and hostile land. Whether he was able to change what counts as rigorous academic argument … well, that’s still up for debate.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/hello-my-name/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a species, we’re obsessed with names. They’re one of the first labels we get as kids. We name and rename absolutely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; around us. And these names carry our histories, they can open and close our eyes to the world around us, and they drag the weight of expectation and even irony along with them. This week on Radiolab, we’ve got six stories all about names. Horse names, the names of diseases, names for the beginning, and names for the end. Listen to “Hello, My Name Is” on Radiolab, wherever you find podcasts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/cuba-ish-2204/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almost exactly twenty years ago, detainee 244 got transferred to Guantanamo Bay. Captured by American forces at the battle Tora Bora five months previous, Abdul Latif Nasser was shaved, hooded, shackled, diapered, and flown halfway across the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Radiolab special series, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/other-latif"&gt;The Other Latif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, kicked off when one of our hosts, Latif Nasser, made a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with detainee 244. A man the U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of as Al-Qaeda’s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser’s lawyer claims, on the other hand, that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash launched our Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what the man with whom he shares a name actually did or didn’t do. Along the way, Radiolab’s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 5: Cuba-ish &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To mark the solemn occasion of the other Latif's transfer to, "the legal equivalent of outer space," we thought we'd replay Cuba-ish, the fifth episode of our special series which first aired back in 2020. In this episode, our Latif heads to Guantanamo Bay to try to speak to his namesake. Before he gets there, he dives deep, seeking the answer to what seems like a simple question: why Cuba? Why in the world did the United States pick this sleepy military base in the Caribbean to house “the worst of the worst”?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support Radiolab by becoming a member of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/membership"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dust-planet-2204/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Horror, fashion, and the end of the world … In this episode, first aired in 2014, but maybe even more relevant today, things get weird as we explore the undercurrents of thought that link nihilists, beard-stroking philosophers, Jay-Z, and True Detective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Today on Radiolab, a puzzle. Jad’s brother-in-law &lt;a href="https://www.johnhuntpublishing.com/zer0-books/our-books/in-the-dust-of-this-planet"&gt;wrote a book called 'In The Dust of This Planet'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/400/620/c/80/1/Cover2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;It’s an academic treatise about the horror humanity feels as we realize that we are nothing but a speck in the universe. For a few years nobody read it. But then …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/620/348/l/80/1/True_Detective.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/02/02/writer-nic-pizzolatto-on-thomas-ligotti-and-the-weird-secrets-of-true-detective/"&gt;It seemed to show up on True Detective.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/594/867/l/80/1/Lilly_Collins.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;Then in a fashion magazine.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="embedded-image"&gt;&lt;img class="mcePuppyImage" src="https://www.wnyc.org/i/620/348/l/80/1/JayZShot.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;div class="image-caption"&gt;And then on Jay-Z's back. How? &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;We talk nihilism with Eugene Thacker &amp;amp; Simon Critchley, leather jackets with June Ambrose, climate change with David Victor, and hope with the father of Transcendental Black Metal - Hunter Hunt Hendrix of the band&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Liturgy/Aesthethica#.VA9NM7ywK68"&gt;Liturgy. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/right-stuff/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the beginning of the space program, we’ve always expected astronauts to be fully abled athletic overachievers who are one-part science-geek, two-parts triathlete – a mix the writer Tom Wolfe famously called “the right stuff.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if, this whole time, we’ve had it all wrong?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, reporter Andrew Leland joins a blind linguistics professor named Sheri Wells-Jensen and a crew of eleven other disabled people on a mission to prove that disabled people have what it takes to go to space. And not only that, but that they may have an edge over non-disabled people. We follow the Mission AstroAccess crew members to Long Beach, California, where they hop on an airplane to take an electrifying flight that simulates zero-gravity – a method used by NASA to train astronauts – and afterwards learn that the biggest challenges to a future where space is accessible to all people may not be where they expected to find them. And our reporter Andrew, who is legally blind himself, confronts some unexpected conclusions of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Andrew Leland and produced by Maria Paz Gutierrez, Matt Kielty and Pat Walters.

&lt;p&gt;Stress can give your body a boost - raising adrenaline levels, pumping blood to the muscles, heightening our senses. And those sudden superpowers can be a boon when you’re running from a lion. But repeatedly dipping into that well can make you sick, even kill you. Since it feels like there’s been an extra bit of stress going around lately, we decided to replay this episode, originally aired back in 2005, which takes a long hard look at the body's system for getting out of trouble. And how in our modern, hyper-connected world, that system misfires and takes us from the frying pan, right into another, albeit entirely different, frying pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford University neurologist (and part-time "baboonologist") Dr. Robert Sapolsky takes us through what happens on our insides when we stand in the wrong line at the supermarket, and offers a few coping strategies: gnawing on wood, beating the crap out of somebody, and having friends. Plus: the story of a singer who lost her voice, and an author stuck in a body that never grew up.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/helen-keller-exorcism/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Fantasy writer Elsa Sjunneson has been haunted by Helen Keller for nearly her entire life. Like Helen, Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up she was constantly compared to her. But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen’s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen’s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It’s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller. It was produced by Sindhu Gnanasambandan and Rachel Cusick, with help from Sarah Qari, Tanya Chawla, and Carolyn McClusker. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jeremy Bloom contributed music and sound design. Additional Mixing by Arianne Wack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Like Helen, Elsa is Deafblind, and growing up she was constantly compared to her. But for a million different reasons she hated that, because she felt different from her in a million different ways. Then, a year ago, an online conspiracy theory claiming Helen was a fraud exploded on TikTok, and suddenly Elsa found herself drawing her sword and jumping to Helen’s defense, setting off a chain of events that would bring her closer to the disability icon than she ever dreamt. For over a year, Elsa, Lulu and the Radiolab team dug through primary sources, talked to experts, even visited Helen’s birthplace Ivy Green, and discovered the real story of Helen Keller is far more complicated, mysterious and confounding than the simple myth of a young Deafblind girl rescued by her teacher Annie Sullivan. It’s a story of ghosts, surprises, a few tears, a bit of romance, some hard conversations, and a possibly psychic dog.<em>This episode was reported by Elsa Sjunneson and Lulu Miller.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/life-barrel/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we flip the Disney story of life on its head thanks to a barrel of seawater, a 1970s era computer, and underwater geysers. It’s the chaos of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latif, Lulu, and our Senior Producer Matt Kielty were all sitting on their own little stories until they got thrown into the studio, and had their cherished beliefs about the shape of life put on a collision course. From an accidental study of sea creatures, to the ambitions of Stephen J Gould, to an undercooked theory that captured the world’s imagination, we undo the seeming order of the living world and try to make some music out of the wreckage. (Bonus: Learn how Francis Crick really thought life got started on this planet).&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/forests-forests/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;For much of history, tree canopies were pretty much completely ignored by science. It was as if researchers said collectively, "It's just going to be empty up there, and we've got our hands full studying the trees down here! So why bother?!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;But then, around the mid-1980s, a few ecologists around the world got curious and started making their way up into the treetops using any means necessary (ropes, cranes, hot air dirigibles) to document all they could find.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week we journey up into the sky and discover Forests above the forest. We learn about the secret powers of these sky gardens from ecologist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/korenamafune"&gt;Korena Mafune&lt;/a&gt;, and we follow &lt;a href="https://nalininadkarni.com/"&gt;Nalini Nadkarni&lt;/a&gt; as she makes a ground-breaking discovery that changes how we understand what trees are capable of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;P.S. This episode is a layer cake of arboreal surprises (including the reappearance of a certain retired host). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few visual tre(e)ats: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/11th-letter-george/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week, Lulu heard an interview that trapped her in her car. She decided to play it for Latif.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interview – originally from a podcast called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://relentlesspicnic.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Relentless Picnic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but presented by one of Lulu’s current podcast faves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://pineapple.fm/the-11th"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 11th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – is part of an episode of mini pep talks designed to help us all get through this cold, dark, second-pandemic-winter-in-a-row. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the segment that Lulu brings Latif is about someone trying to get through something arguably much more difficult, something a pep talk can’t solve, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;but that a couple friends — and one very generous stranger — might be able to help make a little more bearable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The episode of The 11th this comes from is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/im-here-to-pep-you-up/id1566642706?i=1000547543765"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m Here to Pep You Up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; The Relentless Picnic is currently running a series of episodes called CABIN, an audio exploration of isolation, which you can listen to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qvthPp5wUlGhJrWK4o9nI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The organization where Matt volunteers as a counselor is called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/early-death-and-sudep/sudep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;SUDEP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The Lu Olkowski story Lulu recommends at the end of the episode is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/91568-grandpa"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Grandpa,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the lobster story Latif recommends is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/91969-the-luckiest-lobster"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Luckiest Lobster.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She decided to play it for Latif.</p>
<p>The interview – originally from a podcast called <a href="https://relentlesspicnic.com/">The Relentless Picnic</a>, but presented by one of Lulu’s current podcast faves, <a href="http://pineapple.fm/the-11th">The 11th</a> – is part of an episode of mini pep talks designed to help us all get through this cold, dark, second-pandemic-winter-in-a-row. But the segment that Lulu brings Latif is about someone trying to get through something arguably much more difficult, something a pep talk can’t solve, but that a couple friends — and one very generous stranger — might be able to help make a little more bearable.</p>
<p>The episode of The 11th this comes from is <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/im-here-to-pep-you-up/id1566642706?i=1000547543765">“I’m Here to Pep You Up.”</a> The Relentless Picnic is currently running a series of episodes called CABIN, an audio exploration of isolation, which you can listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qvthPp5wUlGhJrWK4o9nI">here</a>. The organization where Matt volunteers as a counselor is called <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/early-death-and-sudep/sudep">SUDEP</a>.

Cyber criminals today have more sophisticated tools, have learned to work collaboratively around the world and have found innovative ways to remain deep undercover in the internet's shadows. This episode, we shine a light into those shadows to see the world from the perspectives of both cybercrime victims and perpetrators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First we meet mother-daughter duo Alina and Inna Simone, who tell us about being held hostage by criminals who have burrowed into their lives from half a world away. Along the way we learn about the legally sticky spot that unwitting accomplices like Will Wheeler find themselves in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then reporter and author Joseph Menn tells us about the surprisingly lucrative professional hacker structure in places throughout the former Soviet Union. Finally, the co-creator of one of the most notorious online marketplaces to ever exist speaks to us and NPR cyber-crime expert Dina Temple-Raston about how a young suburban Boy Scout can turn into a world renowned black hat hacker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/worst-year-ever/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What was the worst year to be alive on planet Earth?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We make the case for 536 AD, which set off a cascade of catastrophes that is almost too horrible to imagine. A supervolcano. The disappearance of shadows. A failure of bread. Plague rats. Using evidence painstakingly gathered around the world - from Mongolian tree rings to Greenlandic ice cores to Mayan artifacts - we paint a portrait of what scientists and historians think went wrong, and what we think it felt like to be there in real time. (Spoiler: not so hot.)  We hear a hymn for the dead from the ancient kingdom of Axum, the closest we can get to the sound of grief from a millennium and a half ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The horrors of 536 make us wonder about the parallels and perpendiculars with our own time: does it make you feel any better knowing that your suffering is part of a global crisis? Or does it just make things worse?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to reporter Ann Gibbons whose Science article "&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.362.6416.733"&gt;Eruption made 536 ‘the worst year to be alive&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;got us interested in the first place. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case you want to learn more about 536, here are some other sources: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timothy P.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/return-alpha-gal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuck your napkin under your chin.  We’re about to serve up a tale of love, loss, and lamb chops - with a side of genetic modification.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several years ago we told a story about Amy Pearl. For as long as she could remember, Amy loved meat in all its glorious cuts and marbled flavors. And then one day, for seemingly no reason, her body wouldn’t tolerate it.  No steaks. No brisket. No weenies. It made no sense: why couldn’t she eat something that she had routinely enjoyed for decades? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turned out Amy was not alone. And the answer to her mysterious allergy involved maps, a dancing lone star tick, and a very particular sugar called Alpha Gal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this update, we discover that our troubles with Alpha Gal go way beyond food. We go to NYU Langone Health hospital to see the second ever transplant of a kidney from a pig into a human, talk to some people at Revivicor, the company that bred the pig in question, and go back to Amy to find out what she thinks about this brave new world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The original episode&lt;/strong&gt; was reported by Latif Nasser, and produced by Annie McEwen and Matt Kielty. Sound design and scoring from Dylan Keefe, Annie McEwen, and Matt Kielty. Mix by Dylan Keefe with Arianne Wack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we gaze into the eyes of a wild animal, or even a beloved pet, can we ever really know what they might be thinking? Is it naive to assume they're experiencing something close to human emotions? Or is it ridiculous to assume that they AREN'T feeling something like that?

Second, cassettes filled with history make an epic journey across Africa with a group of Lost Boys. And finally, Simon meets up with fellow Radiolabber David Gebel to dig through an old box of mixtapes and rediscover the unique power of these bygone love letters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/mixtape-dakou/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through the 1980s, the vast majority of people in China had never heard western music, save for John Denver, the Carpenters, and a few other artists included on the hand-picked list of songs sanctioned by the Communist Party.

A couple hours later, to his own surprise, he saved the life of the President of the United States. But in the days that followed, Sipple’s split-second act of heroism turned into a rationale for making his personal life into political opportunity. What happens next makes us wonder what a moment, or a movement, or a whole society can demand of one person.

Reporter Avir Mitra and science journalist Lydia Denworth bring us a story about how one man’s relentless pursuit of a deep truth about the Earth led to an obsession that really changed the very air we breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/60-words-20-years/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has now been 20 years since September 11th, 2001. So we’re bringing you a Peabody Award-winning story from our archives about one sentence, written in the hours after the attacks, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the "war on terror."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger &amp;amp; Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, we check back in with Congresswoman Lee, and talk to Yale law professor and national security expert Oona Hathaway, about how to move on from the original sixty words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Original episode produced by Matt Kielty and Kelsey Padgett with original music by Dylan Keefe. Update reported and produced by Sarah Qari and Soren Wheeler.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/unsilencing/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, even psoriasis — these are diseases in which the body begins to attack itself, and they all have one thing in common: they affect women more than men. Most autoimmune disorders do. And not just by a little bit, often by a lot; in some cases, as much as sixteen times more. But why? On today’s episode, we talk to scientists trying to answer that question. We go back 100 million years, to when our placenta first evolved and consider how it might have shaped our immune system. We dive deep into the genome, to stare at one of the most famous chromosomes: the X. And we also try to unravel a mystery — why is it that for some females, autoimmune disorders seemingly disappear during pregnancy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported by Molly Webster, and produced by Sindhu &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gnanasambandan and Molly Webster&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Gonads theme song was written, performed, and produced by Majel Connery and Alex Overington. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most autoimmune disorders do. And not just by a little bit, often by a lot; in some cases, as much as sixteen times more. But why? On today’s episode, we talk to scientists trying to answer that question. We go back 100 million years, to when our placenta first evolved and consider how it might have shaped our immune system. We dive deep into the genome, to stare at one of the most famous chromosomes: the X. And we also try to unravel a mystery — why is it that for some females, autoimmune disorders seemingly disappear during pregnancy?</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/everybodys-got-one/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We all think we know the story of pregnancy. Sperm meets egg, f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ollowed by nine months of nurturing, nesting, and quiet incubation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this story isn’t the nursery rhyme we think it is. In a way, it’s a struggle, almost like a tiny war. And right on the front lines of that battle is another major player on the stage of pregnancy that not a single person on the planet would be here without. An entirely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;organ: the placenta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode we take you on a journey through the 270-day life of this weird, squishy, gelatinous orb, and discover that it is so much more than an organ. It’s a foreign invader. A piece of meat. A friend and parent. And it’s perhaps the most essential piece in the survival of our kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2014, India’s Dutee Chand was a rising female track and field star, crushing national records. But then, that summer, something unexpected happened: she failed a gender test. And was banned from the sport. Before she knew it, Dutee was thrown into the middle of a controversy that started long before her, and continues on today: how to separate males and females in sport. First aired in 2018, Dutee and the story of female athletes in sport are back in the spotlight this week, at the Tokyo Olympics.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/queen-dying/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve ever lost someone, or watched a medical drama in the last 15 years, you’ve probably heard of The Five Stages of Grief. They’re sort of the world’s worst consolation prize for loss. But last year, we began wondering… Where did these stages come from in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turns out, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. But the story is much, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; more complicated than that. T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hose stages of grieving? They actually started as stages of dying. After learning that, producer Rachael Cusick tumbled into a year-long journey through the life and work of the incredibly complicated and misunderstood woman who single-handedly changed the way all of us face dying, and the way we deal with being left behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special Note: Our friends over at Death Sex and Money have put together a very special companion to this story, featuring Rachael talking about this story with her grandmother.  Check it out &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/deathsexmoney/episodes/rachael-cusick-grief-radiolab-death-sex-money"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, most people have probably seen Britney Spears' name or face everywhere. When she stood in front of a judge (virtually) and protested the conservatorship she's been living under for the past 13 years, one harrowing detail in particular stood out. She told the judge, "I was told right now in the conservatorship, I'm not able to get married or have a baby." Today, we look back at an old episode where we explore why it is that hundreds of thousands of people can have their reproductive rights denied...and spoiler: it goes back to Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a law student named Mark Bold came across a Supreme Court decision from the 1920s that allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed “unfit,” he was shocked to discover that it had never been overturned. His law professors told him the case, Buck v Bell, was nothing to worry about, that the ruling was in a kind of legal limbo and could never be used against people. But he didn’t buy it. In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity’s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that’s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was produced by Matt Kielty, Lulu Miller and Pat Walters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Featuring interviews with Pace's descendants and over forty musicians, historians, writers, and musicologists, all of whom grapple with Pace’s enduring legacy.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>WNYC Studios</itunes:author><itunes:keywords>Science,Technology,Philosophy,Education,radiolab,jad,abumrad,krulwich,Radio,Lab,wnyc,studios</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>The Vanishing of Harry Pace: Episode 1

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was Motown before Motown, FUBU before FUBU: Black Swan Records, the record company founded by Harry Pace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vanishing of Harry Pace&lt;/em&gt; was created and produced by Shima Oliaee and Jad Abumrad. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Harry Pace founded Black Swan Records exactly 100 years ago. Pace launched the career of Ethel Waters, inadvertently invented the term rock n roll, &lt;span&gt;played an important role in W.C. Handy becoming "Father of the Blues," &lt;/span&gt;inspired &lt;em&gt;Ebony&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jet&lt;/em&gt; magazines, and &lt;span&gt;helped desegregate &lt;/span&gt;the South Side of Chicago in an epic Supreme Court battle. Then, he disappeared.  The &lt;em&gt;Vanishing of Harry Pace&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the phenomenal but forgotten man who changed the American music scene. It's a story about betrayal, family, hidden identities, and a time like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;This series was produced in collaboration with author Kiese Laymon, scholar Imani Perry, screenwriter Cord Jefferson, and WQXR’s Terrance McKnight.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rhino-hunter/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 for a hunting trip to Namibia to shoot and kill an endangered species.  He’s a professional hunter, who guides hunts all around the world, so going to Africa would be nothing new.  The target on the other hand would be. And so too, he quickly found, would be the attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode, producer Simon Adler follows Corey as he dodges death threats and prepares to pull the trigger.  Along the way we stop to talk with Namibian hunters and government officials, American activists, and someone who's been here before - Kenya’s former Director of Wildlife, Richard Leakey.   All the while, we try to uncover what conservation really means in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dirty-drug-and-ice-cream-tub/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode, a tale of a wonder drug that will make you wonder about way more than just drugs.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctor-reporter Avir Mitra follows the epic and fantastical journey of a molecule dug out of a distant patch of dirt that would go on to make billions of dollars, prolong millions of lives, and teach us something fundamental we didn’t know about ourselves. Along the way, he meets a geriatric mouse named Ike, an immigrant dad who’s a little bit cool sometimes, a prophetic dream that prompts a thousand-mile journey, an ice cream container that may or may not be an accessory to international drug smuggling, and - most important of all - an obscure protein that’s calling the shots in every one of your cells RIGHT NOW.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/deep-cuts/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Lulu and Latif talk about some of their favorite episodes from Radiolab’s past that hold new power today.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lulu points to an episode from 2008: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imagine that you're a composer. Imagine getting the commission to write a song that will allow family members to face the death of a loved one. Well, composer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bangonacan.org/about_us/david_lang"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; had to do just that when a hospital in Garches, France, asked him to write music for their morgue, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/lastgoodbye.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Salle Des Departs.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; What do you do? This piece was produced by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.strangemusic.com/JGonzales.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jocelyn Gonzales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Latif talks about an episode Jad made in 2009. Here’s how we described it back then:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jad--a brand new father--wonders what's going on inside the head of his baby Amil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(And don't worry, you don't need kids to enjoy this podcast.) The questions here are big: what is it like to be so brand new to the world? None of us have memories from this time, so how could we possibly ever know? Is it just chaos? Or, is there something more, some understanding from the very beginning? Jad found a development psychologist named &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charlesfernyhough.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charles Fernyhough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to explore some of his questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;amp;utm_medium=radiolab-redirect&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pledge&amp;amp;utm_content=show-notes" target="_blank" title="Pledge"&gt;Radiolab.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine getting the commission to write a song that will allow family members to face the death of a loved one. Well, composer David Lang had to do just that when a hospital in Garches, France, asked him to write music for their morgue, or 'Salle Des Departs.' What do you do? This piece was produced by Jocelyn Gonzales. And Latif talks about an episode Jad made in 2009. Here’s how we described it back then: Jad--a brand new father--wonders what's going on inside the head of his baby Amil. (And don't worry, you don't need kids to enjoy this podcast.) The questions here are big: what is it like to be so brand new to the world? None of us have memories from this time, so how could we possibly ever know? Is it just chaos? Or, is there something more, some understanding from the very beginning? Jad found a development psychologist named Charles Fernyhough to explore some of his questions.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/septendecennial-sing-along/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Every 17 years, a deafening sex orchestra hits the East Coast -- billions and billions of cicadas crawl out of the ground, sing their hearts out, then mate and die. In this short, Jad and Robert talk to a man who gets inside that noise to dissect its meaning and musical components.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most of us hear a wall of white noise, squeaks, and squawks....David Rothenberg hears a symphony. He's trained his ear to listen for the music of animals, and he's always looking for chances to join in, with everything from lonely birds to giant whales to swarming cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, David explains his urge to connect and sing along, and helps break down the mysterious life cycle and mating rituals of the periodical cicadas into something we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

But our say-almost-anything approach to free speech is actually relatively recent, and you can trace it back to one guy: a Supreme Court justice named Oliver Wendell Holmes. Even weirder, you can trace it back to one seemingly ordinary 8-month period in Holmes’s life when he seems to have done a logical U-turn on what should be say-able.  Why he changed his mind during those 8 months is one of the greatest mysteries in the history of the Supreme Court.  (Spoiler: the answer involves anarchists, a house of truth, and a cry for help from a dear friend.)  Join us as we investigate why he changed his mind, how that made the country change its mind, and whether it’s now time to change our minds again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He had lymphoma, and the disease plus his drugs weakened his immune system, making him particularly susceptible to the virus. He wasn’t too bad off, considering, and was sent home. That was Day 1. This is the story of what the doctors witnessed, over the course of his illness: the evolution of covid-19 inside his body.

He had lymphoma, and the disease plus his drugs weakened his immune system, making him particularly susceptible to the virus. He wasn’t too bad off, considering, and was sent home. That was Day 1. This is the story of what the doctors witnessed, over the course of his illness: the evolution of covid-19 inside his body. Before their eyes, they get a hint of what might be to come in the pandemic.  This episode was reported by Molly Webster.  Special thanks to Ravindra Gupta, Jonathan Li.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/ceremony/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In November of 2016, journalist Morgen Peck showed up at her friend Molly Webster's apartment in Brooklyn, told her to take her battery out of her phone, and began to tell her about The Ceremony, a moment last fall when a group of, well, let's just call them wizards, came together in an undisclosed location to launch a new currency. It's an undertaking that involves some of the most elaborate security and cryptography ever done (so we've been told). And math. Lots of math.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/red-herring/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was the early 80s, the height of the Cold War, when something strange began happening off the coast of Sweden. The navy reported a mysterious sound deep below the surface of the ocean. Again, and again, and again they would hear it near their secret military bases, in their harbors, and up and down the Swedish coastline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After thorough analysis the navy was certain. The sound was an invasion into their waters, an act of war, the opening salvos of a possible nuclear annihilation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or was it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Annie McEwen pulls us down into a deep-sea mystery, one of international intrigue that asks you to consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, your deepest beliefs could be as solid as...air.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/smile-my-ass/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Candid Camera is one of the most original – and one of the most mischievous – TV shows of all time.  Admirers hailed its creator Allen Funt as a poet of the everyday. Critics denounced him as a Peeping Tom.  Funt sought to capture people at their most unguarded, their most spontaneous, their most natural.  And he did. But as the show succeeded, it started to change the way we thought not only of reality television, but also of reality itself.  Looking back at the show now, a half century later, it’s hard NOT to see so many of our preoccupations – privacy, propriety, publicity, authenticity – through a funhouse mirror, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Latif Nasser and produced by Matt Kielty. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-money-less-problems/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning and the shelter-in-place orders brought the economy to a screeching halt, a quirky-but-clever idea to save the economy made its way up to some of the highest levels of government. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib proposed an ambitious relief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/Automatic%20Boost%20to%20Communities%20Act%20.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to keep the country’s metaphorical lights on: recurring payments to people to help them stay afloat during the crisis. And the way Congress would pay for it? By minting two platinum $1 trillion coins. (You read that right). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, we take a jaunt through the evolution of our currency, from the gold-backed bills of the 19th century, to the most powerful computer at the Federal Reserve. And we chase an idea that torpedoes what we thought was a fundamental law of economics. Can we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; just print more money? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/sight-unseen/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As the attacks were unfolding on the Capitol, a steady stream of images poured onto our screens. Photo editor Kainaz Amaria tells us what she was looking for--and seeing--that afternoon. And she runs into a dilemma we've talked about before. In&lt;span&gt; December of 2009, p&lt;span&gt;hotojournalist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lynsey Addario, in&lt;/span&gt; was embedded with a medevac team in Afghanistan. After days of waiting, one night they got the call - a marine was gravely wounded. What happened next happens all the time. But this time it was captured, picture by picture, in excruciating detail. Horrible, difficult, and at times strikingly beautiful, those photos raise some questions: Who should see them, who gets to decide who should see them, and what can pictures like that do, to those of us far away from the horrors of war and those of us who are all too close to it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Horrible, difficult, and at times strikingly beautiful, those photos raise some questions: Who should see them, who gets to decide who should see them, and what can pictures like that do, to those of us far away from the horrors of war and those of us who are all too close to it?</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/note-radiolab-team/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past few weeks, there have been a lot of conversations about the tolerance of harassment and bad behavior in our industry and in particular of a person who worked on our show five years ago, Andy Mills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; team wants to say to the people who were hurt, to anyone who has ever felt unwelcome at our show, and to the industry we helped shape: we are listening. We hate that this happened and we apologize to those we failed. At the time, show leadership initiated a response from WNYC to address Andy’s behavior, but it didn’t happen fast enough and it didn’t do enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can’t change the past, but we can promise you that we are all holding this show, and each other, accountable for making sure that no person has to experience anything like that again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe the best journalism demands an open, inclusive process and the widest possible range of perspectives and experiences. As individuals, we promise to put our full hearts to finding and nurturing stories that embrace that range of perspectives and experiences. Listeners: We hope that you’ll hear this commitment in our work ahead, and that you will let us know if you do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And to our fellow journalists: We love making this show, and we love the community of radio and podcast producers who make it possible for us to exist. Nineteen people work here right now. But over the past 19 years, hundreds of you have contributed stories, ideas, questions, criticism, notes or your ears as listeners. We are grateful to you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/covid-christmas-special/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This year was the worst. And as our staff tried to figure out what to do for our last episode of 2020, co-host Latif Nasser thought, what if we stare straight into the darkness … and make a damn Christmas special about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif begins with a story about Santa, and a back-room deal he made with the Trump administration to jump to the front of the vaccine line, a tale that travels from an absurd quid-pro-quo to a deep question: who really is an essential worker? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From there, we take a whistle-stop tour through the numbers that scientists say you need to know as you wind your way (or preferably, don’t wind your way) through our COVID-infested world. Producer Sarah Qari brings us her version of the Christmas classic nobody ever dreamt they’d want to hear: The Twelve Numbers of COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can check out Martin Bazant’s COVID “calculator” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://indoor-covid-safety.herokuapp.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And while our current effort to develop a covid-19 vaccine involves thousands of people working around the clock, the mumps vaccine was developed almost exclusively by one person: Maurice Hilleman. Hilleman cranked out more than 40 other vaccines over the course of his career, including 8 of the 14 routinely given to children. He arguably saved more lives than any other single person. And through his work, Hilleman embodied the instincts, drive, and guts it takes to marshall the human body’s defenses against a disease.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bloc-party/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1996 election, Bill Clinton had a problem. The women who came out in droves for him in ‘92, split their vote in the ‘94 midterms, handing over control of the House and the Senate to the Republican Party. As his team stared ahead at his re-election bid, they knew they had to win those women back. So, after a major polling effort to determine who exactly their undecided ladies were, Clinton turned his focus toward the most important swing vote in the election: the soccer moms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The soccer mom ushered in a new era of political campaigning, an era of slicing and dicing the electorate, engineering the (predominately white) voting bloc characters that campaigns have chased after. Security Moms. Nascar Dads. Joe Six Pack. Walmart Moms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about everyone else? What about the surprisingly swingable corners of this country without a soccer mom in sight?  Inspired by this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thinglink.com/scene/810170295397646337?buttonSource=viewLimits"&gt;&lt;span&gt;exceedingly cool interactive map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Politico, we set out on a mission to make an audio-map of our own. We asked pollsters, reporters and political operatives in swing states: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;what slice of your population is up for grabs? A slice that no one talks about? In this episode, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;we crawl inside the places that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;might hold our country’s future in its hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, all the while asking: are these slices even real? Are there people inside them that might swing this election? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported and produced by Becca Bressler, Tobin Low, Sarah Qari, Tracie Hunte, Pat Walters and Matt Kielty, with help from Jonny Moens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt;With the recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there's been a lot of debate about how much power the Supreme Court should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt;ally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of the Supreme Court justices as all-powerful guardians of the constitution, issuing momentous rulings from on high. They seem at once powerful, and unknowable; all lacy collars and black robes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they haven’t always been so, you know, supreme. On this episode of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, we go all the way back to the case that, in a lot of ways, is the beginning of the court we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also: we listen back to a mnemonic device (and song) that we created back in 2016 to help people remember the names of the justices. Listen, create a new one, and share with us!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died on September 18th, 2020. She was 87.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; This is the story of how Ginsburg, as a young &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lawyer at the ACLU, convinced an all-male Supreme Court to take discrimination against women seriously - using a case on discrimination against men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bringing-gamma-back/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we return to the lab of neuroscientist Li-Huei Tsai, which brought us one of our favorite stories from four years ago - about the power of flashing lights on an Alzheimer’s-addled (mouse) brain. In this update, Li-Huei tells us about her team’s latest research, which now includes flashing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and ways in which light and sound together might retrieve lost memories. &lt;/span&gt;This new science is not a cure, and is far from a treatment, but it’s a finding so … simple, you won’t be able to shake it. Come join us for a lab visit, where we’ll meet some mice, stare at some light, and come face-to-face with the mystery of memory. We can promise you: by the end, you’ll never think the same way about Christmas lights again. Or jingle bells.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This update was reported by Molly Webster, and &lt;em&gt;produced by Rachael Cusick. &lt;/em&gt;The original episode was produced by Annie McEwen, Matt Kielty, and Molly Webster, with help from Simon Adler. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molly's note about the image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those neon green things in the image are microglia, the brain’s immune cells, or, as we describe them in our episode, the janitor cells of the brain. Straight from MIT’s research files, this image shows microglia who have gotten light stimulation therapy (one can only hope in the flicker room). You can see their many, super-long tentacles, which would be used to feel out anything that didn’t belong in the brain. And then they’d eat it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further reading: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/lebanon-usa/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a story of a road trip. After a particularly traumatic Valentine's Day, Fadi Boukaram was surfing google maps and noticed that there was a town called Lebanon... in Oregon. Being Lebanese himself, he wondered, how many Lebanons exist in the US? The answer: 47. Thus began his journey to visit them all and find an America he'd never expected, and the homeland he'd been searching for all along. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was made in collaboration with Kerning Cultures, a podcast that tells stories from the Middle East and North Africa.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The original "Lebanon USA" story was reported by Alex Atack with editorial support from Bella Ibrahim, Dana Ballout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Zeina Dowidar, and Hebah Fisher. Original sound design by Alex Atack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new update of the story was produced and reported by Shima Oliaee. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We had original music by Thomas Koner and Jad Atoui.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Note: In an earlier version of this episode, we inaccurately described a grain elevator. We have updated the audio to reflect the correction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to donate to Beirut at this time, we have links here (from NYT):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.supportlrc.app/donate/"&gt;Lebanese Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; dispatches every ambulance from North Lebanon, Bekaa, and South Lebanon to Beirut to treat the wounded and help in search-and-rescue operations. You can make a &lt;a href="https://www.supportlrc.app/donate/donate.html"&gt;contribution here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ &lt;a href="https://www.wfp.org/"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt; provides food to people displaced or made homeless after the blast. Lebanon imports nearly 85% of its food, and the port of Beirut, the epicenter of the explosion, played a central role in that supply chain. With the port now severely damaged, food prices are likely to be beyond the reach of many. &lt;a href="https://secure.wfpusa.org/donate/urgent-support-emergency-humanitarian-response-lebanon?ms=2008_UNR_LebanonEmergency_NYT_WEB"&gt;You can donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NGO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HI_UnitedStates/status/1291039281037926400"&gt;Humanity and Inclusion&lt;/a&gt; has 100 workers in Lebanon, including physical therapists, psychologists and social workers. They are focusing on post-surgical therapy in Beirut following the explosion. You can make a &lt;a href="https://www.hi-us.org/beirut_explosion"&gt;contribution here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/"&gt;International Medical Corps&lt;/a&gt; is deploying medical units and will provide mental health care to those affected in Lebanon. The humanitarian aid organization also provides health services to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, and vulnerable Lebanese. You can &lt;a href="https://give.internationalmedicalcorps.org/page/65328/donate/1?ea.tracking.id=DP~LB21~DPHPL2108"&gt;donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the Children have launched a Lebanon’s children relief fund, to which you can &lt;a href="https://support.savethechildren.org/site/Donation2?df_id=4450&amp;amp;4450.donation=form1"&gt;donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can make a contribution here.  The United Nations’ World Food Program provides food to people displaced or made homeless after the blast. Lebanon imports nearly 85% of its food, and the port of Beirut, the epicenter of the explosion, played a central role in that supply chain. With the port now severely damaged, food prices are likely to be beyond the reach of many. You can donate here. The NGO Humanity and Inclusion has 100 workers in Lebanon, including physical therapists, psychologists and social workers. They are focusing on post-surgical therapy in Beirut following the explosion. You can make a contribution here. International Medical Corps is deploying medical units and will provide mental health care to those affected in Lebanon. The humanitarian aid organization also provides health services to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, and vulnerable Lebanese. You can donate here. Islamic Relief, which specializes in food aid and emergency response, is helping to put a supply chain in place for emergency aid in Beirut. You can donate here. Save the Children have launched a Lebanon’s children relief fund, to which you can donate here. UNICEF, the United Nations agency specializing in aid to children, is providing medical and vaccine supplies in Beirut, and supplying drinking water to rescue workers at the Beirut port. Its on-the-ground team is also counseling children traumatized by the blast. You can donate here. Impact Lebanon, a nonprofit organization, has set up a crowdfunding campaign to help organizations on the ground, and is helping to share information about people still missing after the explosion. The group had raised over $3 million as of Wednesday and donated the first $100,000 to the Lebanese Red Cross. The health care organization Project HOPE is bringing medical supplies and protective gear to Beirut and assisting the authorities on the ground. A donation page is available here. Over 300,000 people in Beirut were displaced from their homes by the explosion. Baytna Baytak, a charity that provided free housing to health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic, is now raising funds with Impact Lebanon to shelter those who have been displaced. For those in Beirut, here is a list of urgent blood needs.

From &lt;span&gt;Huawei&lt;/span&gt; and 5G to TikTok and viral social media, China is stride for stride with the United States in the world of computing. However, China’s technological renaissance almost didn’t happen. And for one very basic reason: The Chinese language, with its 70,000 plus characters, couldn’t fit on a keyboard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we tell the story of Professor Wang Yongmin, a hard headed computer programmer who solved this puzzle and laid the foundation for the China we know today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, with an eye on the upcoming election, we take a look back: at two pieces from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;More Perfect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; Season 3 about Constitutional amendments that determine who gets to vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Former &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; producer Julia Longoria takes us to Washington, D.C. The capital is at the heart of our democracy, but it’s not a state, and it wasn’t until the 23rd Amendment that its people got the right to vote for president. But that still left DC without full representation in Congress; D.C. sends a "non-voting delegate" to the House. Julia profiles that delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and her unique approach to fighting for power in a virtually powerless role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; producer Sarah Qari looks at a current fight to lower the US voting age to 16 that harkens back to the fight for the 26th Amendment in the 1960s. Eighteen-year-olds at the time argued that if they were old enough to be drafted to fight in the War, they were old enough to have a voice in our democracy. But what about today, when even younger Americans are finding themselves at the center of national political debates? Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He talks to Jad about the hidden forces of the world that connect us all. Then, with an eye on the upcoming election, we take a look back: at two pieces from More Perfect Season 3 about Constitutional amendments that determine who gets to vote. Former Radiolab producer Julia Longoria takes us to Washington, D.C. The capital is at the heart of our democracy, but it’s not a state, and it wasn’t until the 23rd Amendment that its people got the right to vote for president. But that still left DC without full representation in Congress; D.C. sends a "non-voting delegate" to the House. Julia profiles that delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and her unique approach to fighting for power in a virtually powerless role. Second, Radiolab producer Sarah Qari looks at a current fight to lower the US voting age to 16 that harkens back to the fight for the 26th Amendment in the 1960s. Eighteen-year-olds at the time argued that if they were old enough to be drafted to fight in the War, they were old enough to have a voice in our democracy. But what about today, when even younger Americans are finding themselves at the center of national political debates? Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To kick things off, we travel through time from a homeless shelter to a military hospital, pondering the pandemic-fighting power of the sun.

For 126 years, Mississippi has had the Confederate battle flag on their state flag, and they were the last state in the nation where that emblem remained “officially” flying.  A few days ago, that flag came down. A few days before&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, it coming down would have seemed impossible.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/post-no-evil-redux/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today we revisit our story on Facebook and its rulebook, looking at what’s changed in the past two years and exploring how these rules will impact the 2020 Presidential Election. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008 Facebook began writing a document. It was a constitution of sorts, laying out what could and what couldn’t be posted on the site. Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. Today, they’re anything but. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you define hate speech? Where’s the line between a joke and an attack? How much butt is too much butt? Facebook has answered these questions. And from these answers they’ve written a rulebook that all 2.2 billion of us are expected to follow. Today, we explore that rulebook. We dive into its details and untangle its logic. All the while wondering what does this mean for the future of free speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Simon Adler with help from Tracie Hunte and was produced by Simon Adler with help from Bethel Habte.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, we explore the origin of the reasonable officer standard, with the case that sent two Charlotte lawyers on a quest for true objectivity, and changed the face of policing in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Producer Tracie Hunte stumbled into a duet between Nina Simone and the sounds of protest outside her apartment. Then she discovered a performance by Nina on April 7, 1968 - three days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tracie talks about what Nina’s music, born during another time when our country was facing questions that seemed to have no answer, meant then and why it still resonates today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Covid has disrupted the most basic routines of our days and nights. But in the middle of a conversation about how to fight the virus, we find a place &lt;span&gt;impervious to&lt;/span&gt; the stalled plans and frenetic demands of the outside world. It’s a very different kind of front line, where urgent work means moving slow, and time is marked out in tiny pre-planned steps. Then, on a walk through the woods, we consider how the tempo of our lives affects our minds and discover how the beats of biology shape our bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was produced with help from Molly Webster and Tracie Hunte.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It seemed like a small moment. But as he went back to visit her, month after month, what began as a simple act of motherhood became a heroic feat that has never been equaled by any known species on Earth.  This episode was reported and produced by Annie McEwen.  Special thanks to Kim Fulton-Bennett and Rob Sherlock at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

It’s called &lt;em&gt;Why Fish Don’t Exist&lt;/em&gt;. It’s part scientific adventure story, part philosophical manifesto, part chest-ripped-open memoir.

They faced a slew of practical questions like: Who would count the dead and where would they build the refugee camps? But they faced a more spiritual question as well. If Washington DC were hit, every object in the the National Archives would be eviscerated in a moment. Terrified by this reality, they set out to save some of America’s most precious stuff.  Today, we look back at the items our Cold War era planners sought to save and we ask the question: In the year 2020, what objects would we preserve now?  This episode was reported and produced by Simon Adler with editing from Pat Walters and reporting assistance from Tad Davis.  Support Radiolab today at Radiolab.org/donate.  </itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>WNYC Studios</itunes:author><itunes:keywords>Science,Technology,Philosophy,Education,radiolab,jad,abumrad,krulwich,Radio,Lab,wnyc,studios</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>The Cataclysm Sentence
</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/cataclysm-sentence/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day in 1961, the famous physicist Richard Feynman stepped in front of a Caltech lecture hall and posed this question to a group of undergraduate students: “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence was passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, Feynman had an answer to his own question - a good one. But his question got the entire team at Radiolab wondering, what did his sentence leave out? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we posed Feynman’s cataclysm question to some of our favorite writers, artists, historians, futurists - all kinds of great thinkers. We asked them, “What’s the one sentence&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;would want to pass on to the next generation that would contain the most information in the fewest words?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What came back was an explosive collage of what it means to be alive right here and now, and what we want to say before we go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve all been given a simple rule: maintain six feet of distance between yourself and others. But why six? Producer Sarah Qari uncovers the answer, and talks to some scientists who now say six might not be the right number after all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dispatch-3-shared-immunity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than a million people have caught Covid-19, and tens of thousands have died. But thousands more have survived and recovered. A week or so ago (aka, what feels like ten years in corona time) producer Molly Webster learned that many of those survivors possess a kind of superpower: antibodies trained to fight the virus. Not only that, they might be able to pass this power on to the people who are sick with corona, and still in the fight. Today we have the story of an experimental treatment that’s popping up all over the country: convalescent plasma transfusion, a century-old procedure that some say may become one of our best weapons against this devastating, new disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have recovered from Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and want to donate plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, national and local donation registries are gearing up to collect blood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To sign up with the American Red Cross, a national organization that works in local communities, head &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://redcrossblood.org"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;out more about the The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, which we spoke about in our episode, including information on clinical trials or plasma donation projects in your community, go &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ccpp19.org/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;And if you are in the greater New York City area, and want to donate convalescent plasma, head over to the New York Blood Center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nybloodcenter.org/donate-blood/covid-19-and-blood-donation-copy/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;to sign up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nybloodcenter.org/news/articles/new-york-blood-center-collect-first-blood-plasma-donations-recovered-covid-19-patients-treat-severe-cases/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are sick with Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and are interested in participating in a clinical trial, or are looking for a plasma donor match, check in with your local hospital, university, or blood center for more; you can also find more information on trials at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/the-national-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-project/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
