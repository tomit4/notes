          <title>Time to First Byte (TTFB)</title>
          <link>https://web.dev/ttfb/</link>
          <description>Time to First Byte (TTFB) is a foundational metric for measuring connection setup time and web server responsiveness in both the lab and the field. It helps identify when a web server is too slow to respond to requests. In the case of navigation requests — that is, requests for an HTML document — it precedes every other meaningful loading performance metric.</description>

          <title>radEventListener: A Tale of Client-side Framework Performance</title>

          <description>React has its place when complex state management is required. In my experience, however, it doesn’t belong in most scenarios. When even a bit of React is a problem on devices slow and fast alike, using it is a choice to exclude those on low-end hardware.</description>
