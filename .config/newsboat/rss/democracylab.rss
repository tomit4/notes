This could be a lack of resources, public transport, or even time. The Council Data Project in Missoula, Montana, is a new and innovative way to change this and allows for more citizen engagement tools.</p><p>In about 20 hours, Smai Fullerton used pre-existing technology to install an instance of  the Council Data Project for the city of Missoula, Montana. She did this through the encouragement and backing of Open Montana, a new program of DemocracyLab. This project records and digitizes city council meetings. In addition it allows individuals to search key terms from the transcript of the meeting themselves so they can find the information that has the most impact on them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2022/08/pasted-image-0--2-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making Citizen’s Issues Accessible"><figcaption>Search results for City Council Meetings about zoning</figcaption></figure><p>This project allows for more citizen engagement because citizens can stay informed whether people are able to go to the city council meeting or not. When asked the question, “What is the easiest way to get this project all across the country?”,  Smai Fullerton said we need a great story, more immediate use cases, and the ability to provide examples of its utility. </p><p>This technology can also be developed further to be more user friendly and allow for a greater impact. The use of voice recognition to be able to search for specific city council members would be a useful addition so citizens are able to see specific opinions from their community leaders. Some other useful additions to the Council Data Project are: seeing how many times people are interrupted or interrupt someone, a minute count of how much time a member of the city council was speaking, and ability to search for keywords/phrases. The latter of these potential improvements could be the most useful. Vernacular used in a city council meeting versus the way individuals talk to each other and various professional settings are vastly different. Therefore, allowing for a related word search would likely help improve the accessibility for individuals.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2022/08/pasted-image-0--1-.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making Citizen’s Issues Accessible"><figcaption>Search results for events about zoning</figcaption></figure><p>Key information to highlight regarding the Council Data Project is its relation with Open Montana which is the maintainer for the Missoula Council Data Project. Though this technology is in more locations than Missoula it is also the same basic infrastructure. This means the “data processing pipelines, the web frontend, and data storage systems all share the same infrastructure specification.” </p><p>When discussing the features Council Data Project is planning on creating and implementing, Eva Brown had the following to say: “We have a lot of features in development right now. A whole page just for tracking legislation, an audio-based speaker classification model for annotated speaker names in the produced transcripts, a notifications feature that would work a bit like Google Search Alerts (i.e. "a meeting from June 7 discussed 'missing middle housing'"), and some more that are just getting started.”</p><p>All these improvements, though important, are more likely to be seen as part of a long-term plan for this technology and the City of Missoula. The technology of the Council Data Project is very important and with time we expect to see more citizen engagement and will be able to gain personal testimony on how this technology has been useful, and through this, be able to implement it in other cities around the country.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Better Tech-a-thon: ground-breaking collaboration on Public Interest Technology]]></title><description><![CDATA[Students and faculty from leading universities collaborated with tech professionals to contribute to 17 tech-for-good projects at A Better Tech-a-thon.]]></description><link>https://blog.democracylab.org/a-better-tech-a-thon/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">618d25ba15d8f6001e4b3252</guid><category><![CDATA[Civic Tech]]></category><category><![CDATA[collaboration]]></category><category><![CDATA[College]]></category><category><![CDATA[Community]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hackathon]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tech For Good]]></category><category><![CDATA[Upskill]]></category><category><![CDATA[Virtual Hackathon]]></category><category><![CDATA[Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Community Engagement]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[DemocracyLab]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:05:48 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/11/2021.10.14-A-Better-Tech-a-thon-Event-Image.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/11/2021.10.14-A-Better-Tech-a-thon-Event-Image.png" alt="A Better Tech-a-thon: ground-breaking collaboration on Public Interest Technology"><p>Students, faculty, and tech professionals from across the United States recently got together to collaborate on innovative tech-for-good projects as part of A Better Tech-a-thon. <br></p><p>The hands-on virtual event took place on October 14th and 15th, 2021, and was presented by <a href="https://democracylab.org/">DemocracyLab</a>, <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, with sponsorship from <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/impact/community">Amazon</a>.<br></p><p>It was part of the <a href="https://www.abettertech.net/">A Better Tech Public Interest Technology Convention and Career Fair</a> —  the first event of its kind in the US to bring together talented students, leading researchers, organizations, and companies passionate about serving public interest through responsible and accountable tech.  The event was convened by New York University (NYU), with support from <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/pit-un/about/members/">New America’s Public Interest Technology University Network</a>.<br></p><p>The goal of A Better Tech-a-thon was to provide participants an opportunity to hone their skills while networking and making valuable contributions to numerous tech-for-good projects.  Projects were sourced from the Code for America Brigade Network and DemocracyLab and ranged in missions from educating children about the trees around them, to making it easier to locate food donation sites.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1SNpMzX4wecJ6uqradM2E55f2vZcIN56DLBFgfVb_yZDh2QZ9AcZ--hACbSa5uhnfIinWuTh2OvuHPbGs9_p4kGCKMfLWRv3FWIS3PKbtcl2KYdk3YKkasE63b6fhyOX0ctFnDNA" class="kg-image" alt="A Better Tech-a-thon: ground-breaking collaboration on Public Interest Technology"></figure><p><a href="https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/hana-schank/">Hana Schank</a>, co-director of the Public Interest Technology program at New America and author of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691216638/power-to-the-public">Power to the Public</a>, said that looking at the participating projects was like “taking a spin through people’s hopes and dreams for a better world.”<br></p><p>“The world that you are all envisioning is a beautiful place where technology is used intelligently and thoughtfully to connect people instead of dividing them;

The following year in 2019, there was an average of one <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/us/2019-us-school-shootings-trnd/index.html">school shooting every school week</a>. But despite the frequency of such tragedies, nothing was done at scale to analyze data from the events to identify patterns and help prevent further catastrophe.</p><h2 id="seeing-the-forest-through-the-trees">Seeing the forest through the trees</h2><p>Professor and technology advocate Paul Privateer believes that technology is an intricate part of our social consciousness. In under a year, the world developed and distributed a COVID-19 vaccine, and people immediately went to work building aggregate search tools that allow anyone to find nearby doses. Why, wonders Professor Privateer, do we as a society not have the same response to school violence? With the right resources, parents or teachers could monitor behavioral changes in an individual, correlate them the location and demographics of a school, and see in an instant whether those data predict violent actions. With enough time to intervene, we could potentially prevent more tragedies from happening.</p><h2 id="an-idea-born-of-tragedy">An idea born of tragedy</h2><p>Throughout his career Paul Privateer has been a professor of technological sciences and digital culture at San Jose State, Arizona State University, Georgia Tech, and MIT. The idea for the Athena Project was born during his tenure at Arizona State University, after two graduate students committed suicide within a few months of each other. As Paul grieved the loss of these young people along with his community, he asked his colleagues to brainstorm ways that they could use technology to understand and analyze the psychological and social factors of violence towards oneself or others. Unable to get federal funding, they decided to proceed on their own. From this starting point Professor Privateer founded his Seattle-based non-profit NoSchoolViolence.org in 2017.</p><h2 id="the-athena-project">The Athena Project</h2><p>The Athena project under the NoSchoolViolence umbrella is developing a national school violence database that’s searchable via a user-friendly app. Paul found that data about incidents of school violence were recorded in over 40 separate, local systems in narrative “trend reports.” Using powerful data science software, the team has been able to pull reports from the disparate sites housing the information, run comparative analyses to identify common data points, and organize that data into tables.</p><p>The long term goal of this project is to provide the Athena app as a resource for parents, school faculty and administrations, researchers, health professionals, state education departments, and state and federal agencies. The app will help them understand which combinations of behaviors and traits correlate to violence, and will offer tested and effective intervention methods. Through this analysis users will be able to build and sustain successful violence prevention programs.</p><h2 id="current-state-and-next-steps">Current state and next steps</h2><p>Paul has attended 10 DemocracyLab hack-a-thons where he connected with volunteers skilled in wireframe design, search, machine learning, and natural language processing. At each event, Paul and the volunteers worked to advance the quality of the project’s dataset and the efficiency of its search models. By participating in these events Paul has discovered what improvements will benefit the project most and moved the Athena project forward iteratively. Once the backend data is fully converted, Paul will focus on refining the app's search models.</p><h2 id="get-involved">Get Involved</h2><p>Currently, this project is still in the development phase, and there are lots of ways to get involved. If you’re a designer, data savvy, or specialize in machine learning, and you want to help create the first national school violence database and search tool this is a great project for you.</p><p><strong>The <a href="https://democracylab.org/projects/354">Athena project</a> is looking for volunteers with the following skills:</strong></p><ul><li>Machine learning experience</li><li>Working knowledge of search engines</li><li>Natural language processing</li><li>Data Conversion for structured queries</li></ul><p>If you're not yet registered, <a href="https://democracylab.org/signup">registering with DemocracyLab is free and easy</a>.</p><hr><p>DemocracyLab is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission to empower people who use technology to advance the public good.

A Smart City collects and analyzes the data it produces to make improvements in areas like accessibility, sustainability, and walkability. During the pandemic countries like <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-01-01/covid-travel-singapore-pandemic-quarantine-lockdown">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html">Korea</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-day3-audrey-tang-taiwan/">Taiwan</a> used Smart City techniques to keep track of and contain Covid-19 infections. </p><p>The Smart City market is forecast to become a trillion-dollar industry, and many private companies are jumping in to create technologies to make cities more livable for residents. However, ethical concerns have arisen about private corporate control of cities' public data. Luckily people like Dr. Xuesong Zhou are working on open source projects, creating transparent alternatives that give the power to make data-driven decisions back into the hands of the community. Given that<a href="https://graylinegroup.com/urbanization-catalyst-overview/"> millions of  people </a>are moving to cities every week, efficiency has become an essential priority.</p><h2 id="the-vision-of-a-communal-tool">The Vision of a Communal Tool</h2><p>Dr. Xuesong Zhou is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at Arizona State University specializing in dynamic traffic assignment, traffic estimation and prediction, and large scale routing and rail scheduling. He’s also passionate about the democratization of urban planning. He saw the potential of OpenStreetMap, an open source alternative to Google Maps, but knew it needed better functionality if it were to compete as a city planning tool. The Smart City Planning project was born.</p><p><br>The data packages built by Dr. Zhou and his partners extract the OpenStreetMaps data and add layers to make it more usable. To date, it’s been downloaded over 16,000 times from Github and is being used by universities and departments of transportation across the nation, including by Cambridge Systematics Inc. in the modeling system developed for Northern Virginia Transportation Authority’s TransAction Program.<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AnRPFFDAi-rH3LlgvFtUEAO3SGIVbovLETCRwcAL-TWb3nL07qWYZsrlzqSnXhhvMpBjtJW41pSOWHEDv-Rdrtu1fxOBANVEywl6-Y1tkft_zuPPUUGePsrdU-2gNTt6sOT3n3VQ" class="kg-image" alt="Optimizing Municipal Infrastructure with Smart City Planning"><figcaption>Photo Credit: Smart City Planning</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-bridge-between-data-and-community">The Bridge Between Data and Community</h2><p>For Dr. Zhou, the various problems affecting cities (traffic, pollution, accessibility) are related and solvable with data. By bringing together academics, community leaders, and non-profit organizations, he hopes to develop an open data source that will serve as the framework for running simulations and informing data-driven infrastructure decisions. Dr. Zhou has also been an avid participant in DemocracyLab’s hackathons, where volunteers updated the data package versions with additional data layers, such as traffic light timing.</p><p>That vision is already beginning to manifest. Through a program sponsored by Arizona State University, high school students have been able to contribute to Dr. Zhou’s project. Earlier this year, Xenia Zhao worked with Dr. Zhou to research food bank optimization in her local city and her paper won first place in the Arizona Science and Engineering Fair. The high school student currently working with Dr. Zhou, Rachel Dai, is using the Smart City data package combined with US census data to understand how to optimize accessibility for vulnerable and elderly populations</p><h2 id="the-future-of-smart-city-planning">The Future of Smart City Planning</h2><p>The long-term goal of the project is to build digital “twin cities” that mirror the physical space and infrastructure of a metropolitan area. Users will be able to easily run real-time simulations that model a city's utilities, transportation, physical infrastructure, civic services, and more. By building digital twins that are accessible and easy to use, the project enables community-supported city planning. Dr. Zhou hopes to continue partnering with high school and college students who are passionate about social change and who want to work on creative ways to use technology to improve their cities.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get Involved</h2><p>The Smart City Planning project is currently looking for anyone familiar with OpenStreetMaps software or knowledge of Python, especially high school or college students interested in sharpening their skills with hands-on experience.

Students of color and the LGBTQ community remain underrepresented in many healthcare jobs, and the number of medical students from rural areas is <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/rural-health-crisis-number-medical-students-from-rural-backgrounds-declined-28-over-15">declining</a>. Given that the White population in the US is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S245230112030016X">projected to fall 10%</a> in the upcoming decades, the gap is likely to widen if nothing is done.</p><p>Northwest Health Career Path (NWHCP) believes a healthcare workforce should reflect its community and works to support diversity in healthcare. NWHCP’s mission is to make it easier for underrepresented people to access the resources they need to successfully launch a career in healthcare. NWHCP has created one place to find everything from summer camps and after-school programs, to workshops and internships, as well as college access programs, and more. The website serves students from middle schoolers to postgraduates.</p><p>With NWHCP’s free interactive map, users can find nearby resources fitting their education level and career focus, as well as financial and transportation needs. Longer term, NWHCP hopes their initiative will facilitate collaboration between organizations to create a more complete ecosystem of support for these students as they navigate through the sometimes complex landscape of higher education.</p><p>NWHCP is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington Medical School Service Learning Program and several regional partners.

University programs and online learning institutions alike have prioritized this field of study to meet the growing demand for data professionals, and a <a href="https://online.maryville.edu/online-masters-degrees/business-data-analytics/careers/">Maryville University's data analytics careers page</a> makes it clear that this has resulted in data making its way into businesses of all kinds.<br><br>Organizations driving social and environmental initiatives are no exception, having opened their doors to data analytics experts to improve internal efficiency and external practices alike. While the applications for data analytics in this space are limitless, the fundamental idea is quite simple, as described in an <a href="https://theconversation.com/data-science-is-a-growing-field-heres-how-to-train-people-to-do-it-110449">article in <em>The Conversation</em> on data science</a>: <em>extract insight from data</em> — that is, gather measurable information and determine what it says about performance and potential.<br><br>To fully understand the benefits, it's helpful to break data analytics down into simple steps to see how the idea is transforming businesses and organizations.</p><h2 id="1-gather-data-">1. Gather Data:</h2><p>The first step in any data analytics operation is to gather the data itself, which can be done in a number of ways, depending on the type of organization, including combing through transaction histories, assessing finances, monitoring customer feedback and social media conversation, and/or maintaining numbers related to website performance. These are just a few examples of the means by which company and organization leaders can begin to gather the data that will serve as the foundation for an analytics operation.<br><br>Keep in mind also that this shouldn’t sound overwhelming. While it’s true that gathering data requires some effort, and the more data the better, a lot of this process is typically automated. With the right tools and software, even a small organization can collect a great deal of valuable information.</p><h2 id="2-draw-insights-">2. Draw Insights:</h2><p>People tend to imagine data analytics as a thoroughly advanced process involving complex computation. The not-so-secret truth though is that once an organization gathers its data, it can begin discovering insight with relative ease, often by simply turning raw information and numbers into something that can be interpreted clearly and at a glance.<br><br>This process is referred to as data visualization, which means turning data into charts and graphs. Creating simple visual representations out of unclear sets of information helps in analyzing the data and strategizing plans.</p><h2 id="3-apply-learnings-">3. Apply Learnings:</h2><p>Once an organization has its data in an easy-to-digest format, leaders can begin making key improvements.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify where operations are breaking down and falling short.</strong> <a href="https://blog.democracylab.org/using-data-analytics-for-good-civic-tech/">Last summer’s blog post on ‘Using Data Analytics for Good’</a>  touched on this very idea, noting that surveys in test communities had helped an analytics team to “understand what isn’t working and what is needed.” It really is about as simple as that. Whether in startups, civic engagement, or even big business, one of the key purposes of data analytics is figuring out what’s going wrong and why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify growth opportunities.</strong> Spotting opportunities is in fact leading many organization leaders today to hire analysts or enlist volunteers from what has become a robust talent pool of data experts. As an example, a trained analyst might observe data that indicates the success of a particular outreach effort at generating engagement, and from there develop ways to repeat or imitate that effort on a continual basis. Someone in this role drives data-driven decision-making efforts, taking advantage of insights to revamp strategy and seize opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve targeting and outreach strategies.</strong> Data analytics is also used to target customers (or partners, donors, voters, and so on). <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/do-more-with-data-6bc71f6eb4b3">This article by Towards Data Science</a> delved into how targeting and outreach works, essentially pointing out that organizations can use data to glean demographic information about consumers. Whether this information relates to socio-economic status, purchasing history, location, interests, or any other factors, it can help organizations of all kinds sharpen their outreach efforts towards targeted audiences in specific ways that are more likely to work than a more general approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Any organization leader — of a non-profit, a volunteer group, an app-based company combating climate change, or anything similar — can appreciate the potential benefit of this sort of data collection. In the simplest of terms, more insight into operations (both internally and with regard to customers or communities served) lays the foundation for improved performance. All of these efforts are transforming organizations of all kinds, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.<br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[WGU Helps Community College Students Hack for the Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[WGU is reshaping education with its online performance-based approach.

Last year’s St. Hack-trick’s Day event was scheduled for the 14th, but with Seattle being the early epicenter of the outbreak we had a decision to make. We cancelled our reservation to use Code Fellows’ space and scrambled to find a way to make it all work online. You’re welcome to read our <a href="https://democracylab.ghost.io/virtual-tech-for-good-hackathon-after-action-report/">after-action report</a> to hear how it went.</p><p>Now a full year into virtual hackathons, we can see that the pandemic accelerated us in the direction we wanted to go, but weren’t quite brave enough to leap toward - events with no geographic bounds. We’re excited to now see volunteers and projects from all over the world participating in our events.

A full team of Google.org fellows are supporting the City of Seattle to build this application as Seattle provides important resources to low income residents including utility discounts and child care assistance. However, the single portal that is currently used to apply and process for these resources is very inefficient. CiviForm hopes to improve the application process by allowing residents and their Trusted Intermediaries to apply to multiple City of Seattle assistance programs without needing to re-qualify for each. Also it aims to improve the efficiency in the application review and approval process for program administrators who work for the City of Seattle.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/04/SHD-Open-Data-Streams.png" class="kg-image" alt="2nd Virtual St. Hack-trick’s Day Accelerates Civic Innovation"></figure><p><a href="https://democracylab.org/projects/705"><strong>Portland Open Data STREAMS</strong></a> uses an evaluation framework for open datasets published by the city of Portland to create a data analysis tool which provides quality assurance for datasets made available between bureaus and to the public.

For the candidates running for these lesser-known offices, it’s hard to be seen by voters.  The media coverage isn’t there, and social media advertising is expensive and difficult to get right. And with over 500,000 elections across the country, plenty of candidates – and voters – are not able to participate in the democratic process to their full potential. So, how do we solve this problem? Enter: Undebates.</p><p><strong><strong>How Undebates Works</strong></strong></p><p>Undebates is a way for voters to quickly get to know candidates and for candidates to gain exposure to voters – for free! It can be deployed for elections all across the country.</p><p>Undebates worked with Ballotpedia, a portal which voters already use to learn about the candidates before they vote. Ballotpedia covers elections for all federal and state offices, plus the 100 largest U.S. cities. In partnership with Ballotpedia, Undebates creates a customized link for each candidate. The link leads to a video interview which guides the candidate through several questions, the responses to which are recorded. It also gives the candidates the opportunity to rerecord their answers and review everything before posting.</p><p>After a candidate’s answers are posted, they automatically become part of the Undebate for that office, and the link to that Undebate is then included in the info page for that candidate as well as the info page for that office if more than one candidate has recorded. (On Ballotpedia, these are called “Candidate Conversations.”)</p><p>When voters access the Undebates, they look like a regular debate. But Undebates move quicker, and voters can skip candidates or questions, as well as go back and review them if need be. </p><p><strong><strong>How DemocracyLab Helped Undebates</strong></strong></p><p>The idea for Undebates came about in August of 2019, and the MVP (minimum viable product – or prototype) was ready in time for the Nov. 5, 2019 elections. The first Undebate, which involved the candidates for the San Francisco District Attorney’s race, looked like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/04/Undebates-image1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Undebates: Making Democracy More Accessible"></figure><p>At the November 19 Hack To Give Thanks, hosted by DemocracyLab, the developers of Undebate worked with two designers, one of which joined the Undebates team, to improve the design. </p><p>Now the user interface looks like this: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/04/Undebates-image2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Undebates: Making Democracy More Accessible"></figure><p>In March, Undebates teamed up with DemocracyLab again for the 2020 St. Hack-trick's Day with the goal of improving its email campaign to invite candidates to do interviews. With the help of two volunteers, the team was able to implement email automation through Klaviyo with an email campaign that looked like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/04/Undebates-image3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Undebates: Making Democracy More Accessible"></figure><p>This effort resulted in videos from two of the mayoral candidates for Onalaska, Wisconsin.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/04/Undebates-image4.png" class="kg-image" alt="Undebates: Making Democracy More Accessible"></figure><p>Through 2020, Undebates worked with volunteers from DemocracyLab, HackforLA.org, and Taprootplus.org. In the 2020 elections, 91 candidates recorded Undebates for the Nov. 3 general elections, and 67 recorded for the primary elections before that. </p><p>But the Undebates team isn’t stopping there. Plans for the future include a self-service portal where election leaders for student council, homeowners’ associations, unions, and other democratically run organizations can create their own Undebates.  Undebates also wants to support Americans with Disabilities in its user interface and by making transcriptions more accurate.<strong> </strong></p><p>Through volunteer contributions to the open-source code base, Undebates hopes to make democracy work better. The DemocracyLab team is proud to have been able to assist in such a vital goal, and we look forward to making elections more accessible for all voters in the future.

A self-described lifelong naturalist and former software engineer at Tableau, Arielle has worked for the Seattle government for 3.5 years, and is currently a Civil Engineer with Seattle Public Utilities. In 2020, she learned that a tree survey internship program run by the city had been cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. That's when she realized that the software the youth program had been planning to use had no universal mobile interface. Thus, the idea for iSeaTree was born. Simmons-Steffen originally pitched the idea for the app to the Seattle government for funding, but when the coronavirus pandemic hit, there was understandably little room in Seattle Public Utilities' budget for anything beyond helping citizens keep the water on. Simmons-Steffen turned to DemocracyLab’s volunteer network to help get the app off the ground.</p><p>Simmons-Steffen credits DemocracyLab as being a “critical infrastructure piece” in the development of the app. The iSeaTree team participated in two of DemocracyLab's bi-monthly public hackathons and was able to add three long-term junior developers to their crew. The team then participated in our <a href="https://blog.democracylab.org/how-amazon-hacked-for-good/">Hack for Good event with Amazon</a> in December. Through the Amazon hackathon, the junior developers were able to work with and get advice from seasoned Amazon employees, which Simmons-Steffen is grateful for. “DemocracyLab helped us build our core dream,” Simmons-Steffen said. “You came in at the perfect time.” iSeaTree is now in its second version and is racing toward version 3 in time for tree-measuring season in the spring.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/03/50676417046_20d2d619f5_o.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="iSeaTree Nurtures Community Scientists"><figcaption><em>A young conservationist in the field</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-iseatree-works"><br>How iSeaTree Works</h3><p>iSeaTree is available for free on iOS and Android and is designed for all ages and skill levels. Users simply record information about the trees they find, such as species and diameter at breast height (DBH), and then are rewarded with special badges and fun facts about the tree species. For those who are new to tree surveying, the iSeaTree online forum can help with species identification. Simmons-Steffen connected the mobile interface to the U.S. Forest Service <a href="https://www.itreetools.org/">iTree API</a>, allowing users to access tree benefit calculations while in-field, as well as save the data they collect.</p><p> Simmons-Steffen’s primary goal with iSeaTree is to develop a smart, young usership that’s interested in learning manual tree identification, and not just relying on machine learning algorithms (which are often wrong and still require correction). What better way to engage a young population and make remote learning fun than by making it a game? Simmons-Steffen wants the data collectors using iSeaTree to be just as rewarded as the people using the data, and the iSeaTree team is currently working on expanding gameplay for future versions of the app. Simmons-Steffen particularly hopes to increase usership, especially among students and educators. Now that the app is functional in the United States and Canada, she hopes to see usership expand geographically as well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/03/iSeaTree-app-screenshots-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="iSeaTree Nurtures Community Scientists"><figcaption><em>Screenshots from the iSeaTree app</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-future-of-iseatree"> <br>The Future of iSeaTree	</h3><p>Beyond expanding usership of the app, Simmons-Steffen hopes to partner with an established conservation agency to further the growth and adoption of the tool. Her philosophy is that an engaged population is more vital than the data collection itself, and she hopes that other companies and projects will adopt this mindset for their products. </p><p>Interested in helping with iSeaTree’s product, business, and community development?  You can visit Simmon-Steffen’s Tree Mama blog <a href="https://treemama.org/">here</a> or iSeaTree’s <a href="https://www.democracylab.org/index/?section=AboutProject&amp;id=502">profile</a> on DemocracyLab and help build a dedicated community of tree surveyors.</p><p><em>Story by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailey-miller-554a62206/">Kailey Miller</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Amazon Hacked for Good]]></title><description><![CDATA[Amazon's Self Service Performance Ads team strengthened their culture and boosted employee enthusiasm through a virtual tech-for-good hackathon. ]]></description><link>https://blog.democracylab.org/how-amazon-hacked-for-good/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">601a050d38ab2b001ebf0d09</guid><category><![CDATA[Tech For Good]]></category><category><![CDATA[Partner Highlights]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[DemocracyLab]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/02/Does-Amazon-Give-Back.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="engaging-employees-for-social-impact-advances-corporate-goals">Engaging Employees for Social Impact Advances Corporate Goals</h3><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2021/02/Does-Amazon-Give-Back.png" alt="How Amazon Hacked for Good"><p>Few companies have impacted our world as significantly as Amazon.

In short, it is when a group of volunteers band together under one roof - in this case, a virtual workspace - and work collectively on design and technical projects. DemocracyLab’s hackathons are different from most. Projects and participants are encouraged to work collaboratively rather than competitively, and focus exclusively on technology projects that advance the public good. </p><p>Countless studies have found that employees don’t just want to work, they want to engage in activities that make a positive impact on the world. A <a href="http://pwc.blogs.com/files/future-of-work-report-1.pdf">recent PwC survey</a> found that 65% of people across various countries “want to work for an organization with a strong social conscience. Companies that promote active corporate volunteer programs see higher employee morale and a healthier, more energetic culture.” Additionally, a <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/company-culture/2018/companies-volunteering-culture">LinkedIn study</a> noted that “while establishing employee volunteer programs is an obvious way for companies to give back to their communities and build their brands, there’s an additional benefit: volunteer programs are a powerful engagement and retention tool. In fact, when employees feel connected to their company’s giving and volunteering efforts, turnover drops by an average of 57%.” Furthermore, the study found that 79% of candidates “would prefer to work for a socially responsible company.”</p><p>The benefits of organized volunteerism don’t stop at employee morale and retention, though. They go all the way to the bottom line. A recent <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/culture-of-purpose.html">Deloitte case study</a> found that 91% of respondents (executives and employees) who said their company had a strong sense of purpose also said their company had a history of strong financial performance.</p><p>Amazon has repeatedly shown itself to be a leader in finding ways to empower its employees to change the world, because they realize the importance of doing so. One of those ways was partnering with DemocracyLab on an internal Hackathon with their SSPA team.</p><h2 id="which-projects-did-the-amazon-sspa-team-work-on">Which projects did the Amazon SSPA team work on?</h2><p>For the Amazon SSPA Hack for Good event, members of the DemocracyLab team vetted projects that were interested in participating, then selected projects that were a good match for the interests and skills of the Amazon engineers, managers, designers and user experience professionals that were participating.

Feel Happier.”  The app itself is very user-friendly; all someone needs to do is post a request or offer for help; this can be anything such as looking for a lost wallet, asking for help on a college assignment, borrowing a charger, ask directions, or even saying you just want to spend time with someone.  People with a 2-block radius would reply within an hour and can work out the details via the texting feature within the app. This straightforward use removes social barriers and makes introductions easy.  Additionally, there no need to sign-up for an account or set up a profile, and the app offers ‘Kudos points’ for future rewards.  Similar to Uber, users of Mayo can also review the experience of those providing assistance.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/democracylab-blog/2020/11/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Mayo App - Creating Purposeful, Supportive, In-Person relationships beyond Screens"></figure><h2 id="mayo-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-beyond"><br>Mayo during the Coronavirus Pandemic and Beyond</h2><p><br>Chan encourages people in communities to invite them to use the app and to spread the word online and in-person wherever possible, in addition to sharing positive “Mayo Moments” of people using the app.  As the app is very useful in high-population environments, Chan has considered integrating the platform in meet-up environments and universities.  In the meantime, Chan and his team are continuously improving the app to increase genuine real-world connections for people.</p><p><br>Mayo is also taking steps to be of assistance during the Coronavirus Pandemic. They share articles on <a href="https://www.heymayo.com/blog">their blog</a> on how to ask for help, and how to help others while also staying safe.   </p><p><em>“...Some people are desperately hungry. Some people cannot afford medical treatment. Most people are living paycheck-to-paycheck. These are the 'overlooked' who are most affected by this global pandemic. Now is the time to stop, reflect, and offer help to those who need it the most.”  </em></p><p>The team at Mayo developed an app to create a positive social impact on others; now is the time where people need those positive social impacts the most.</p><p><br>Interested in helping with Mayo’s product, business, and community development?  You can contact them via <a href=" https://www.democracylab.org/index/?section=AboutProject&amp;id=387">this link</a> and contribute to a world where it’s easy for people to ask and provide help.  </p><p><br>Join us at our <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-to-give-thanks-2020-tickets-120636676547">Hack To Give Thanks</a> this upcoming November 21 to help projects just like Mayo!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
