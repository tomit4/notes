			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan and Jordan take a Wacky Wednesday break from talking about Alex Jones to take a little look into some chaos in Project Camelot land. Sweary Kerry has been pretty mad lately about a British guy who is making a documentary about how her friend Mark Richards is not a space captain (which he is not), but actually a murderer (which he is). As professional Mark Richards analysts, the gents decide that they need to know a little more about this situation, so they dig in and see what's up.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan and Jordan enter the home stretch, episode 4 of their coverage of Alex Jones' 2009 "documentary" The Obama Deception. In this installment, we pick up on a cliff-hanger and learn about how insane Ron Paul's brother is, then learn a little bit about Ron's career in the House of Representatives. It's not all Paul family stuff this episode though, there's also some historical revisionism and more made-up quotes.</p>]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan tells Jordan about a couple days back in 2009 and all the nonsense Alex Jones had to say back then.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan and Jordan check in on what Alex Jones is up to in the present day and find both very expected and very surprising things. On the very expected side, Alex gets super bigoted, then spends a disproportionate amount of his show talking about how he should be more cocky about how good his body is.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a Special Report that Alex Jones put out on Saturday, May 19th. Alex doesn't usually work on Saturdays, so you know something serious is up. As it turns out, it looks like Roger Stone is in trouble, so Alex headed to the studio to vaguely threaten Robert Mueller and lie a bunch about some dead guys.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan listens to the voice of the people and brings Jordan up to speed on what is going on in modern day Alex Jones. Unfortunately, the day that they end up covering involves Alex reporting on the murder of over 50 Palestinians by Israeli soldiers by mostly just talking about Muslims being bad. That isn't the most fun, but to make things even less fun, Milo Yiannopoulos shows up to "joke around" with Alex to try to drum up some cheap free press about their dumb jokes.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan tells Jordan all about what happened during Alex Jones' 8 PM shift during his recent "Help Me I'm Being Sued" Marathon. It's a classic esoteric performance by a drunk Alex, covering such diverse topics as "how Alex is a victim because of the lawsuits against him" and "how Alex is a victim because the listeners of his show don't give him enough money." Definitely high end political talk.</p>]]></description>

The gents break down how Alex responded to the news that Andrew Breitbart had died. We all cope with loss in our own way, and Alex apparently copes by lying a whole lot and spreading conspiracy theories about the deceased.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan tells Jordan all about an episode of The Alex Jones Show where Alex Jones keeps retelling a story about running into an "authoritarian" in a hot tub while on vacation. The story cannot be true, but it's fun to watch Alex give it more and more layers of lies as time goes on. Also, Alex lies a bunch about the UN to scare his listeners and pulls off one of the harshest ad pivots in history.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan tells Jordan all about a very groundbreaking episode of The Alex Jones Show, where we get a sense of where Alex's martyr complex comes from, and whether Alex prefers "facts" or "lore."</p> <p>This episode was broadcast the day after LaVoy Finnecum was killed at the Oregon Wildlife Preserve Standoff. That event has put Alex Jones into the kind of headspace where he accidentally says a number of things that he usually keeps inside, and luckily, Knowledge Fight is here to bring those things to light.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, Dan and Jordan finish up the 2015 investigation for real over a bottle of wine.

Probably a coincidence that he was hanging out with a dirty trickster and psyop specialist at the time.</p>]]></description>

Topics covered include:</p> <ul> <li>Are there "cows with human titties?"</li> <li>Does Alex think his ancestors literally talk to him?</li> <li>How long does Alex hope Megyn Kelly's kids live?</li> <li>Is Alex a professional impressionist?</li> </ul>]]></description>

Topics covered on today's episode:</p> <ul> <li>Alex "intentionally" "jumps the shark" (?)</li> <li>Alex is fooled by criminally edited anti-Planned Parenthood propaganda videos</li> <li>A caller convinces Alex that Jade Helm is real, and that the UN is operating out of a Walmart in Alabama</li> </ul>]]></description>
