					<description><![CDATA[submitted anonymously &#8211; Along with others around the country, we invite you to join us in organizing festivals of resistance on the weekend&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>submitted anonymously &#8211;</em></p>
<p>Along with others around the country, we invite you to join us in organizing festivals of resistance on the weekend of January 18, immediately before Donald Trump takes office. This is a crucial opportunity to engage in outreach, education, and action ahead of what it is sure to be a tumultuous time.</p>
<p>Once Trump takes power, it will only become more challenging to make connections with our neighbors, create the networks that we will need to face down his assaults, and share the skills we will need to survive his reign. Right now, we have a precious window of time in which to prepare. Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p>When Donald Trump enters office on January 20, he will order mass deportations, escalate the repression of protesters, dismantle the few judicial and legislative provisions that still protect ordinary people, and consolidate a propaganda ecosystem intended to stupefy us all into obedience. The Democratic Party is willingly handing power to an autocrat they say will bring democracy to an end; the Democrats show every intention of continuing to ratchet their own politics to the right. Authoritarian leftist groups are simply treating this as a recruitment opportunity.</p>
<p>But from Texas to the West Bank, millions of people’s lives are about to get even harder. We owe it to each other to meet the second Trump era side by side in solidarity.</p>
<p>The chaos that will accompany the return of the Trump administration represents an opportunity as well as a challenge. This is a chance to assert an autonomous pole of organizing, carrying forward the lessons of 2020 and the movement against Cop City while continuing the fight against patriarchal violence, white supremacy, and colonialism.</p>
<p>By organizing ahead of Trump’s inauguration, we can seize the initiative and set our own timeline rather than being caught flat-footed and forced to react. We need to welcome new participants into these struggles and foster a revolutionary perspective that can orient us through the challenges ahead. No amount of internet activity could substitute for gathering face to face. The most important battles ahead will not be fought online, but in the streets of our communities.</p>
<p>January 18 is observed as the Day of the Forest Defender. It will be the two-year anniversary of the murder of Tortuguita in Weelaunee Forest. It is an important date to gather, honor the memory of the fallen, and pledge ourselves to resistance and to one another.</p>
<p>How to Participate</p>
<p>You could start by calling for an assembly bringing together everyone who wants to participate in organizing. It could be a public gathering—if you think you can facilitate something on that scale—or an invitation-based conversation bringing together people who have already worked together or at least have cause to trust each other.</p>
<p>For the event proper, you could host workshops and distribute literature teaching security culture, digital security, protest safety and first aid, direct action, reproductive autonomy, forms of organization including affinity groups, and other skills that may be relevant in the years to come.</p>
<p>Local organizers could share stories and lessons from the history of resistance in your area during the first Trump era. You could facilitate discussions to identify what people need to do to prepare for the years ahead—both for their own safety and to ensure the safety of their communities—or to strategize about how to prepare to confront the Trump agenda in your region. You could do an art build for future demonstrations and an organizing fair to connect people to local projects. This will be a chance to expand rapid response networks for community defense and mutual aid.</p>
<p>In some places, the gatherings could conclude with public actions—a first salvo in the resistance to Trump’s plan for mass deportations. Elsewhere, there will be open assemblies, spaces for people to encounter each other and learn new ways of working together and sharing ideas. Small towns can screen documentaries or invite speakers to share their expertise.</p>
<p>It’s up to you and your community to decide what best fits your local context. The important thing is to create a space that can serve as a point of entry for everyone who needs to get connected ahead of the next round of struggles—a space where people can hone their skills and begin to think of themselves as a collective force.</p>
<p>No matter who Trump’s administration targets—whether immigrants, Palestine solidarity organizers, sex workers, schoolteachers, trans people, environmentalists, or people seeking abortions—we must show that we will love and protect one another. If we all pull together, showing everyone who wants to resist that there are movements that they can join, we can begin to build the strength that we will need to overcome the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>Events like this are already being planned in dozens of cities and towns. But time is tight. If we want to be ready, we have to get started now.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From The No Trace Project &#8211; French • Greek • Italian • Portuguese • Russian • Spanish • Tagalog This text is addressed&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>From <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/three-proposals.html">The No Trace Project</a> &#8211;</em> </p>



<p><em><a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/trois-propositions.html">French</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/treis-protaseis.html">Greek</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/tre-proposte.html">Italian</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/tres-propostas.html">Portuguese</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/tri-predlozheniia.html">Russian</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/tres-propuestas.html">Spanish</a> • <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/three-proposals/tatlong-panukala.html">Tagalog</a></em></p>



<p>This text is addressed to the international anarchist movement, which we&#8217;ll define as the sum of individuals fighting for anarchist ideas around the world. This movement is in conflict with its natural enemies — the State, fascist groups, and so on — and must protect itself if it is to survive in this conflict. In this text, we make three proposals for the international anarchist movement to consider in the coming years in order to allow anarchists to continue attacking while limiting their chances of getting caught.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-1-share-knowledge-internationally">1. Share knowledge internationally</h2>



<p>Our enemies organize internationally through cooperation between police and intelligence agencies and new developments in science and technology — the increasing precision of DNA forensics and the proliferation of drones being just two examples. This means that a repressive technique used in one country may soon appear in another where it is not yet being used. It also means that an effective countermeasure used by anarchists in one country may be effective in another. <strong>We should therefore share knowledge of repressive techniques and countermeasures on an international level.</strong></p>



<p>Ideally, any experience of repression or experimentation with countermeasures that might be of interest to other anarchists should be written up, translated into several languages, and made public. When anarchists are arrested and brought to trial, we can often obtain court documents that reveal how they were caught: we should exploit this and publish analyses of such documents, bearing in mind that information obtained in this way may be partial or distorted. We should experiment with new countermeasures and write and publish reports on these experiments (except in cases where the State might adapt and weaken the countermeasure by reading the report). We should try to collect information at the source: read police training manuals, steal police files, analyze data leaks from police servers.</p>



<p>A specific feature of the international anarchist movement is its decentralization. We see this not as a weakness but as a strength: in addition to preventing the hierarchies inherent in centralized organizations, it makes it harder for our enemies to target us because they cannot topple the whole movement by disrupting one part of it. However, this decentralization also makes it harder for us to share knowledge across borders. To overcome this, we see two options: developing informal bonds with other anarchists by meeting at international book fairs and other events, and using the Internet. We propose using the No Trace Project as an international platform to share the knowledge that is suited for sharing on the Internet, not as a replacement for informal bonds but as a useful supplement to spread information beyond existing informal networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-2-establish-a-security-baseline">2. Establish a security baseline</h2>



<p>Anarchists who carry out direct actions should analyze the risks associated with their actions and take appropriate precautions: dress anonymously, be mindful of video surveillance and DNA traces, and so on. However, this is not enough. If only those who carry out actions take precautions, it is easier for our enemies to target these individuals. This is, firstly, because they stand out: if only a handful of comrades always leave their phones at home, for example, this could be an obvious starting point for an investigation with no other specific leads. And secondly, because our enemies can get information about them through their friends who do not carry out actions: if someone doesn&#8217;t use social media but is mentioned on their friends&#8217; social media, for example, an investigation could query their friends&#8217; social media to get information about them. <strong>We should therefore establish a security baseline that everyone in anarchist networks agrees to follow, including those who have never carried out direct actions and have no intention of doing so.</strong></p>



<p>We can&#8217;t say what this baseline should be, as it will depend on each local context, but we can give some ideas. As a bare minimum, everyone should help hide information from our enemies by not speculating about who is involved in an action, not bragging about one&#8217;s own participation in an action, not talking to the police, and encrypting any computer or phone used for conversations with other anarchists using a strong password. Discuss sensitive matters exclusively outdoors and without electronic devices, and don&#8217;t make it obvious to your social environment who you are having sensitive conversations with (e.g. don&#8217;t ask someone to “go for a walk” in front of people who aren&#8217;t involved in the project being discussed). In addition, we think everyone should stop using social media (and definitely stop posting photos of other anarchists, even with their consent, because this helps the State map anarchist networks) and leave their phones at home at all times (not just during actions). Carrying your phone with you <a href="https://anarsec.guide/posts/nophones">has security implications for everyone you interact with</a>.</p>



<p>It can be difficult to convince people to follow such a security baseline, especially if they think they have no personal interest in following it. If someone is reluctant, we should remind them that it&#8217;s not just their security that&#8217;s at stake, but also the security of other anarchists around them who may be carrying out or planning to carry out direct actions. Everyone who wants actions to happen has an interest in making anarchist networks as difficult as possible for the authorities to repress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-3-explore-new-horizons">3. Explore new horizons</h2>



<p>Our enemies evolve over time as they refine their strategies and techniques. We should prepare not for the battles that already took place, but for those yet to come. <strong>We should therefore go beyond our current security practices, anticipate the evolution of our enemies, and develop new countermeasures.</strong></p>



<p>Here are three issues we think the international anarchist movement should explore in the coming years.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-drones">Drones</h3>



<p>Aerial surveillance is rapidly becoming cheaper and more efficient. How should we react to the presence of police drones at riots, anarchist events, and so on? How can we detect or take down drones? Should we prepare for the risk of drones being used for routine aerial patrols, and if so, how?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-facial-recognition-technologies">Facial recognition technologies</h3>



<p>In 2023, a journalist tracked down German left-wing militant Daniela Klette, who had been in clandestinity for decades, by using facial recognition technology to match a decades-old photo of her with a recent photo from Facebook taken during a dance class. What can we do against this threat? How can we prepare for the increasing integration of facial recognition technology into public video surveillance systems?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-lack-of-insight-into-police-activity">Lack of insight into police activity</h3>



<p>Until a few years ago, radio scanners were used by anarchists to monitor police frequencies, for example to learn about nearby police activity while carrying out a direct action. In most contexts, this is now impossible because police communications are encrypted. Can we develop new techniques to functionally replace radio scanners or, more generally, to gain insight into police activity in a given area?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="header-about-the-authors">About the authors</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re the No Trace Project. For the past three years, we&#8217;ve been building tools to help anarchists understand the capabilities of their enemies, undermine surveillance efforts, and ultimately act without getting caught. We plan to continue in the years to come. We welcome feedback. You can visit our website at <a href="https://notrace.how">notrace.how</a>, and contact us at notrace@autistici.org.</p>



<p>This text is available as a zine (in <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/zines/three-proposals/three-proposals-booklet-letter.pdf">Letter</a> and <a href="https://www.notrace.how/blog/zines/three-proposals/three-proposals-booklet-A4.pdf">A4</a> dimensions).</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s prepare ourselves, and may luck be on our side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Submitted anonymously &#8211;</em></p>



[I am writing as an insurrectionary anarchist in the u$a and speaking to that context]



<p>Unity Of Fields is a counter-info project that emerged in August of 2024. They describe their project as &#8220;a militant propaganda front against the US-NATO-zionist axis of imperialism.&#8221; It used to be Palestine Action US and has since changed its orientation. It has a website and some social media accounts, some of which have are banned at the time of this writing, they seem to be most popular on Telegram. Although it links to mostly anarchist sources for technical knowledge, Unity Of Fields does not seem to be an anarchist project and their political reading and media suggestions are all over the map. They suggest classic decolonial texts by Fanon and Cesaire, Black liberation writings from the BLA and BPP, texts from various Palestinian resistance factions, as well as authoritarian communists like Lenin and Mao among others.</p>



<p>Mostly their website is a clearing house for news, action analysis, and communiques. Many of the communiques posted are original submissions though they also repost from other counter-info projects and from social media. They also post some of their own original writings to their website. The fact that they post sketchy criminal stuff and link to technical advice on how to better carry out insurrectionary forms of struggle is probably a large part of why they are discussed in anarchist circles at all.</p>



<p>What does the emergence of a project like Unity Of Fields mean for us as anarchists? For one thing Unity Of Fields expands some spaces we occupy as anarchists &#8212; the combative struggle space and the digital counter-info space. We are clearly not the only ones re-coloring walls, opening windows, and carrying out our little sabotages and then writing about it, though at least for now others seem to look to our collective knowledge and experience for technical guidance. We are sharing a struggle space, one which is not limited to riotous moments and combative demonstrations, with other rebels who have made themselves visible to us. We are being included (at least some of the time) in a dialogue with other rebels through the sharing of our words and news of our actions, and anarchists have shared writings from Unity Of Fields on our own websites.</p>



<p>Local struggles against zionism, imperialism, and colonialism are visibly taking on more destructive, decentralized, anonymous, and autonomous approaches, a long-term dream of insurrectionary anarchists, yet new questions arise for us. How do we want to contend with other rebels with whom we have ideological differences and tactical similarities? How do we avoid getting lost in the vanguardist, unifying, nationalist tendencies that often accompany revolutionary leftist approaches to combative struggle? Are we interested in conspiring with these others outside the spontaneity of spiky demonstrations, occupations (and potentially riots), and if so how?</p>



<p>As anarchists we both seek to expand and connect anarchic forms of struggle yet also hold a healthy skepticism of unity with people who don&#8217;t hold anti-authoritarian views of freedom. Our history includes many betrayals by the left and progressives, from peace policing at demonstrations to executions and imprisonment from newly established revolutionary governments. The question of who to coalesce with and why is not an easy one, and one that is best addressed on a case by case basis. The appearance of Unity Of Fields potentially facilitates the dialogues and understanding that can help us better decide if and how we want to team up. As anarchists can often find ourselves isolated from others who we may have some political parallels with, the opening up of a &#8220;militant propaganda front&#8221; is a bridge to dialogue and learn across. This is not a call to join forces with anyone on the basis of being anti-zionist or anti-amerikkkan, it&#8217;s simply a reminder to always be analyzing the changing terrain around us and to think critically as we carry forward our struggles.</p>



<p>&#8220;Towards The Last Intifada&#8221; and &#8220;Towards Another Uprising&#8221; seem to be the beginnings of a dialogue among anarchists that address some of these questions. I look forward to more.</p>

<p>PS: Some Thoughts On Spectacle</p>



<p>Many if not most of the actions posted to Unity Of Fields are accompanied by some visual media, usually photos, sometimes videos. I want rebels to consider some pitfalls of spectacularizing our struggles. Every photo or video is another crumb for the state to eat up as part of their investigations. Digital media can offer up metadata about where and when and what kind of device it was recorded on if not properly removed. Footage that shows rebels gives the state valuable information, such as number of participants, approximate time of day, whether any passersby were present, as well as biometric data even when a person is masked. Height, skin tone, gait, approximate weight, and other information can be determined from even grainy footage.<br>Additionally there are the downsides of understanding our struggles in a quantitative way. This approach may blunt the qualitative changes that participating in struggle can bring us individually and collectively. Of course propaganda is useful, the seductive appeal of revolt is made easier with imagery, and these things must be weighted out, no struggle will be pure. I want to remind us that though this is the path that is being worn into the ground, it is not the only one, and should we choose it let us choose it intentionally.</p>

<p>Need a new place to dump your trash, paint, eggs, silly string, or any other undesirable objects? Look no further than 904 16th Ave E &#8211; the home of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.</p>
<p>It can be easy to forget that genocide enabling companies are made up of real people who make real decisions that lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths. It’s for this reason that a group of community members took it upon themselves to egg and spray paint messages like &#8220;Andy Jassy Bombs Kids // Free Palestine&#8221; at Jassy’s house in the early hours of halloween morning. Amazon Web Services (and Google Cloud) is currently in contract with the israeli occupation forces (iOF) via Project Nimbus &#8211; a 1.22 billion dollar deal that provides cloud computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and other technology services to the iOF, which has drastically sped up israel’s ability to surveil, track, target, and bomb Palestinians since 2021. In an expose published by +972 Mag, israeli occupation forces gush at the the &#8220;exponential capacity of the AWS public cloud&#8221; and it allowing the IOF to have “endless storage” for holding intelligence on almost “everyone” in Gaza. israeli military operatives rely so much on Amazon&#8217;s AWS so that one source who used the cloud-based system during the current war described making “orders from Amazon” for information while carrying out their operational tasks, and working with two screens — one connected to the army’s private systems, and the other connected to AWS.</p>
<p>Seattlites specifically, and people all in the so-called US have a unique position to disrupt big tech like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, and the companies and people who are complicit in and actively profiting off of genocide deserve no peace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>submitted anonymously &#8211;</em></p>
<p>Answering the national call to &#8220;shut down tech&#8221; on October 24th, autonomous groups of community members targeted Microsoft headquarters outside of Seattle, breaking glass jars full of &#8220;blood&#8221; (red paint) on its Executive Briefing Center building, pouring &#8220;blood&#8221; on the big Microsoft sign, and leaving behind the message &#8220;Azure: Drop Israel Not Bombs&#8221; painted in dozens of places. This action brought attention to connections companies in Seattle have with the israeli occupation forces (IOF), that many are unaware of.</p>
<p>A recent article in +972 Magazine exposed how Microsoft&#8217;s cloud computing software, Azure, has been crucial to the criminal military operations conducted in Palestine and Lebanon. The article, quoted an IOF colonel  who said that the cloud services provided by Microsoft and other major tech companies have led to “very significant operational effectiveness” in the Gaza Strip. This officer further described the cloud computing capabilities as a “weapons platform” that included applications to mark targets for Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) drone strikes. In particular, +972 highlighted Microsoft’s Azure as the military’s main cloud provider.</p>
<p>Microsoft has shown time and time again that it values profit over people, whether that be the tens or hundreds of thousands of people it helps slaughtering, or its own employees it censors and fires for speaking out against the company&#8217;s unethical actions.<br />
The main target was the Executive Briefing Center in which all of Microsoft’s executives meet, discuss, and come to powerful decisions, ​​​​​​​like those relating to war crimes and human rights violations. Every member who works in the Executive &#8220;Bombing&#8221; Center is aware of and complicit in the actions that the company is taking.</p>
<p>Where there is oppression, there will be resistance. And the movement will continue to expose and escalate against local entities&#8211;like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google&#8211;that are aiding the israeli occupation and genocide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>submitted anonymously &#8211;</em></p>
<p>In accordance with the international youth call to besiege the embassies and consulates of states complicit in the genocide being carried out by US-backed Israel, an attack was carried out against the German consulate in Seattle.</p>
<p>The German regime has once again chosen the side of genocide. Its administration has repeatedly denied the genocide in Gaza and enacted some of the harshest repression against the movement for a free Palestine.</p>
<p>In the late hours of Tuesday, October 22nd (The day of action against police) a small crew descended on the building. Messages were tagged, red paint covered the walls and windows were smashed.</p>
<p>This act is dedicated to the people of Jabalia, Beit Lahia, and all those in northern Gaza who are bravely resisting their attempted extermination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>submitted anonymously &#8211;</em></p>
<p>Comrades,</p>
<p>For more than three years the peoples of Burma have waged popular resistance against a military junta, which seized power after a landslide defeat in the country’s elections. Even before the coup, ethnic rebels in the countryside have been waging a decades-long resistance against the Burmese central government. Now, in a historical moment, the entire people has united to strike final defeat into both the fascist dictatorship which has since birth plagued the country, as well as the chauvinist and divisive approach of the “Burmese” state against the many peoples of the land.</p>
<p>Most of the country is again in the hands of the people, with the dictatorship retreating everywhere and on the defensive- but the hardest battles are still yet to come. The times ahead of us mark a crucial period of transition and development as the revolutionary forces consolidate the strength to be able to confront the junta in their strongholds. We believe the time has come for internationalists, as they have always done, to come to the side of the people and organize in the defense of the revolution.</p>
<p>To this end we announce the Anti-fascist Internationalist Front, a vessel for individuals of all nationalities to join the people of Myanmar in their resistance to the dictatorship, and invite all who consider themselves anti-fascist or revolutionary to contact us at the email below.<br />
Until victory,</p>
<p>ANTI-FASCIST INTERNATIONALIST FRONT<br />
