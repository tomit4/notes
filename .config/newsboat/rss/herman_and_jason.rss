			<title><![CDATA[What about fusion energy? | E41]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We're back!! It's 2023 and all we're thinking about in the start of the new year is fusion energy! In this episode we talk about the recent breakthroughs in fusion energy at the National Ignition Facility in US and we go through a mirage of topics such as what actually happened; what is the impact of having commercially available fusion energy; and how we can accelerate energy transformation in South Africa too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.helionenergy.com/">Helion Energy</a><br>
<a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/">Casey Hanmer - Terraform Industries</a></p>
<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>
<p>(0:20) Experiencing a cricket &amp; more intense versions of it. (3:30) Brief chat about coffee making. (4:40) Recent breakthroughs in the fusion space. (6:00) The cost to get this far, the transition and what about solar? (6:50) When could it be here and what are the companies that could do it? (9:20) The state of load shedding and will fusion be too late for South Africa? Other renewable mechanisms used in developing economies - is there a market for fusion power? (11:52) Jason has doubts about the cost that it will take to get modular fusion to market. (13:38) Fundamental problem with tokamaks &amp; accelerators and how they work? (17:15) Converting fusion energy to electricity still needs to happen &amp; how Helion's system works. (20:00) Evolution of the electricity grid away from what fusion can bring. (22:00) How to finance the switch to alternative energy sources. (25:07) What are the things to look forward to when there is cheap, viable fusion available. (30:00) Carbon credits from direct-air carbon capture and devices that could reimagine shipping, and the effect on vertical farming. (33:50) How do we accelerate this transformation? (37:00) Geopolitical &amp; economic impact of having fusion technology and where South Africa might have missed in terms of energy policy.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Reflections on 2022 | E40]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to all our valuable listeners who tune in on a regular basis! In this episode we cover some of the interesting things that happened in 2022 and what the future may hold for next year. We cover topics like energy security in South Africa and the world, AI and it's affects on the internet &amp; the commoditization of art via NFTs, the economic down-turn and if there are any upsides to look out for in the new year.</p>
<p><strong>This is our last episode for 2022</strong> but don't fear - we'll be back at it in 2023 with more curious content. If you like what we're doing here please subscribe to get updates as soon as we release new episodes.</p>
<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>
<p>(0:00) Getting started and warming up! (01:45) Talking about the changes in the monachy (3:15) We get started with the actual podcast! (03:45) The growth of AI in the last few months and how it's probably a powerful tool, could it replace "ground breaking" writing though? ChatGPT? Stable Diffusion and other interesting developments around AI. (8:40) ChatGPT3 as a disruption for Google, Stack Overflow and others. (10:25) The crash in NFT &amp; crypto hype, how royalty systems are still being worked out. Why artists don't necessarily like NFTs and how the down-turn could be a net positive. (14:25) The great chess cheating scandal and how computers are allowing for more advanced styles of play. (17:30) The huge economic downturn in the tech industry and most places, layoffs and loads of distress in the geo-political sense. Is there an upside in more discipline. (21:20) The proliferation of remote work and how it could contribute to economic growth in South Africa. How the move could be a great thing for tourism. (24:50) Something interesting about Iceland - the country. How re-forestation could change the landscape of this volcanic island (28:00) How the problems with Eskom and load-shedding could get much worse? Could diversification of energy could be the new future of South African energy? (33:00) The problems with local solar and how to finance it and find consensus to build energy independence. The innovation that's needed to make a change. (39:00) Negativity bias without thinking about how far we've come and the misplaced assumption of stability. (42:00) A footnote on adaptability to change and the upper atmosphere project to prevent climate change. (44:05) Patagonia donation to environmental protection and maybe it'll get worse. How to make small steps towards bigger changes. The ocean cleanup project. (48:30) Personal plans for the new year from both Herman &amp; Jason and what to do next year with the podcast.</p>

(22:00) Hacker homes for building ideas and companies to build opportunity for new business. (24:40) What makes a good co-working space? (29:00) Why don't public libraries become co-working spaces?

			<title><![CDATA[#33 Longevity (part 2) - How to think about human longevity]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We continue on the topic of longevity, this time we focus on human longevity. We talk about some of the types of illnesses we get as we age and some of the processes that can make life after 30 harder. We chat about some of the approaches we take and how we think about health, exercising and staying on track with exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>
<p>(0:00) Working hard at the gym. (2:44) Herman takes a big leap forward. (4:35) We kick things off and start talking about longevity in humans. (5:58) What does your penultimate decade look like? (8:45) Jason is in a small town in Barcelona with a load of old age homes. (11:55) Aerobic capacity, VO2 max measurements and working backwards and why marthons are bad ideas. (14:55) What exactly is aging from a genomic perspective? (18:05) The top down approach from a disease perspective. Top causes of death in South Africa. (19:35) How to approach health as a 30 year old and environmental stressors. (23:20) Where did we come from as a species? (26:35) What do we do now as a practice and how do we take a baseline? (31:35) What is the best exercise to do? (35:30) The third important thing about longevity. (36:35) Keeping busy as a way to keep going on and three ways to categorize how to approach health.&nbsp;</p>

(7:20) Some of the boundaries of developing this technology. (8:55) Organic mechanisms for carbon capture such as trees, why it's not enough. (11:15) Bio fuels as another organic mechanism, algae to extract carbon dioxide &amp; putting it underground. (16:52) Basalt rock as a storage mechanism for carbon dioxide. (19:17) Converting carbon dioxide to starch &amp; food for cattle and animal feed. (24:00) Jason isn't listening very carefully.

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies for the poor sound quality in this episode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you rent or buy a house, and what are the pros and cons of both? In this episode we discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Internet in Thailand&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The economics of renting and buying&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The personal aspect of renting and buying&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Personal non-negotiable requirements when it comes to our living spaces&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How we aren&apos;t financial advisors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🛖🏘🏢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to leave us &lt;strong&gt;feedback&lt;/strong&gt;, feel free to use the box in the episode page on Spotify! We&apos;re eager to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Our infinite energy future]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>A new year! A new season! We're switching things up, focusing in &amp; improving on what we learned from our podcast in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this season Herman &amp; Jason talk about what life would be like if energy wasn't an issue. Could we have electric planes that could fly us around the world... what would the timelines be for that?. Would oil &amp; coal become a thing of the past?! What would be the social and economic effects of such a technological (or magical) breakthrough?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discuss it all &amp; more over a cup of old brown coffee!</p>
<p>We'd love to hear your feedback: https://80g3w8i19s3.typeform.com/to/q2FaIuNO</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Herman & Jason start a podcast! ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>What an exciting move!! But as with most things in life, this involves a big leap into an uncomfortable new world. These two buddies chat about what it means to start a podcast and some of the other things in their lives that have made them a little uncomfortable. Herman started his own small business; Jason is moving to London &amp; both of them are sitting in a small phone booth somewhere in Cape Town on chairs with exactly the wrong number of legs.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
