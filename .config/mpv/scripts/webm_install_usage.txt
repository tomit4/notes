The webm.lua file is a simple lua script for making simple audio/video clips from directly
within mpv. It is already correctly nested within this directory, and no further
configuration is necessary for use.

From within mpv, simply type Shift+w which will bring up a small
self-explanatory menu on how to create clips.
