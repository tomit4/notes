Manjaro XFCE FireFox-Developer-Edition Settings
While you can certainly harden firefox by hand, it can be time consuming, simply put prefs.js in:

~/.mozilla/firefox/k6634gl6.dev-edition-default/prefs.js

Or whatever path looks like that, you can always search for it using locate (recommended).

locate prefs.js
