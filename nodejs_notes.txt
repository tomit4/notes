There are some simple things every basic web project will need when working nodejs
One of these is that the npm init and npm install commands are pretty much universal
When creating a basic website that has a backend

once you are satisfied with the basic index.html, about.html etc. documents and intend
to create a backend side of the website, at some point you will want to create the package.json
file that will list all the npm depencies as well as other essential information about the project

to create the package.json file, very simply type in the terminal:

npm init

once you have determined which packages you will need from the npm, list them in the depencies of the
package.json file
and then type in the terminal:

npm install

This will install all dependencies listed in the dependencies property of the package.json file.

sudo npm install -g nodemon

nodemon <server.js>

sudo npm install -g autocannon

autocannon is an HTTP benchmarking tool, it can be invoked like this;

autocannon --connections 100 http://localhost:3000/

allocates a pool of 100 concurrent connections to our server, default is 10.
The number of concurrent connections should be altered to best represent teh naticipated load on your server,
so you can simulate production workloads.

autocannon --connections 100 --duration 20 http://localhost:3000/

or more syntactically shortened:

autocannon -c 100 -d 20 http://localhost:3000
