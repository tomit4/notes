Hi Artist! Your input regarding my battery notification issue got resolved mainly due to your input. I'm very curious as to how this actually works though and why dunst relies on dbus. I'm trying to learn the inner workings of Linux and Unix systems in general right now, so this struck my curiosity. How is it that the following lines you suggested resolved my issue:

[code]
echo 'export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS='$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > /tmp/dsba &
chmod +x /tmp/dsba &
/tmp/dsba &
 [/code]

Please if you could enlighten me on this bit of information, I'd be grateful for a more in depth response as to how this works.

And thanks again!
