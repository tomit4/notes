cron is a very useful tool for the automatic running of scripts on a timed
basis.

as of this writing, I only really have one cronjob I utilize on my home desktop,
a notification script to run fstrim on the first of every month:

To create such a cronjob, invoke:

crontab -e

And edit the file to include the following:

0 * 1 * * $HOME/scripts/fstrim_notify.sh

Within $HOME/scripts/fstrim_notify.sh:


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# simple cron script to notify to possibly run trim script

LAST_UPDATE=$(/usr/bin/cat $HOME/.fsdate)
env DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="place_your_dbus_info_here" /usr/bin/notify-send "fstrim alert!, last fstrim on:
${LAST_UPDATE}"

A simple script is then run manually called $HOME/scripts/trim:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# this script is meant to simply notify to fstrim
# it also updates a .fsdate file in $HOME with the date of the last fstrim

# allows to overwrite .fsdate file
set +o noclobber

doas fstrim --all --verbose --minimum 1048576 &&
notify-send " ï…Š  fstrim completed!!"

date > "$HOME/.fsdate"
