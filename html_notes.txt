#There are some interesting keyboard shortcuts that will help us write our html
#pages faster.  Keep in mind that saving default index.html files, etc will also be helpful

#To create a standard html page, simply type:
html
#to get options in vs code, choose "html5", and you will get a basic html page

#putting after the meta name tag a generic  css link as follows:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
#is pretty much standard

#and putting in a generic javascript file as follows:
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
# will create a link to a standard javascript file and the defer will make sure
#it is read after the html/css is first processed

#hitting a .class*2 will create
	<div class="class"></div>
	<div class="class"></div>

#while doing the same with #id*2 will create
	<div id="id"><div>
	<div id="id"><div>

Sometimes the spacing on html pages is thrown off, or you'll change the wording in an already styled element, and it's only off by a space or two. to generate spaces, you can't simply type spaces, you'll have to use html space symbols:


    & Nbsp; Blank box with half-width continuous rows (recommended)
    & Ensp; halfwidth Space
    & Amp; emsp; fullwidth Space

Example: <p>&ensp;Actual Text<p>

This will add a halfwidth space behind the "Actual Text" in the paragraph tag.
