<h2>A Colection of My Personal Computer Related Notes</h2>

This repository simply contains a series of notes I have accumulated over a series of time regarding Computers/Programming.
Some of them are simply lists of programs I like or commands I have found useful.  My memory can't possibly hold all the information.
So I have committed them to a series of notes on my computer.  This repostiory acts both as a storehouse of my personal knowledge regarding
computers and programming, mainly dealing with Linux and its vast array of commands and programs.
