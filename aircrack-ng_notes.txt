So far we're having difficulties using aircrack-ng suite.

Firstly in order to capture the handshake, we have to put our wifi card into montitor mode, this is done simply by:

airmon-ng start wlan0

OR

doas ifconfig wlan0 down
doas iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
doas ifconfig wlan0 up // does not work, network is in monitor mode

Then we can use the airodump-ng suite to use wlan0 as a monitor for packets:

airodump-ng wlan0

However this runs forever and will give us an idea of the traffic traveling through our wifi.

I have found that running iwconfig again the the mode managed brings up our wifi and network list,
but does not actually reconnect to the internet for some reason...

doas iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
doas ifconfig wlan0 up //works, but no internet...

---REGARDLESS LET'S DOCUMENT WHAT WE DO NOT---

USE aircrack-ng WITH john:
https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Aircrack_and_John_the_Ripper

ip a // shows all internet protocol interfaces

ifconfig // does the same more or less

ifconfig wlan0 down (takes down wireless network)

doas airmong-ng start wlan0 // sets wireless interface in promiscuous mode, creates wlan0mon

doas airmong-ng check kill // kills wpa_supplicant

ip a // should now just show wlan0mon as wireless interface (this turns your wireless card into a wireless scanner essentially)

airodump-ng wlan0mon (will bring up airodump-ng menu that then shows BSIDs and MAC addresses, press a to toggle MAC address menus)

Open up another terminal session

airodump-ng -w capture1 --output-format pcap --bssid <BSSID of target wifi> --channel 1 wlan0mon

This will open up another airodump-ng menu that will show only whether or not there has been a wireless handshake in a secondary menu.

You will have to try multiple times inputting STATION addresses, they should be on the same channel (single digit number)

Once you have connected, under your second airodump-ng menu you should see in the secondary field the connected BSSID with its respective STATION address (after a certain amount of time, the handshake will end and you will have to try again).

What is not yet known is whether or not the respective capture1-01.cap (sometimes there are multiples) was given enough time to capture the handshake packets which would then be used to finally break the password against a dictionary list (possibly generated using John The Ripper).

There is also the matter of somehow reconnecting to our home wifi afterwards...
