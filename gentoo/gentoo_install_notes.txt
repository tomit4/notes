A general speedrun guide to installing gentoo can be found at:

Install a basic distribution-bin kernel first, then you can:

You can get your current compiler flags from:

zcat /proc/config.gz

You can just output it and then save it as a default that you have.

Also, you can find these same compiler flags in:

/usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config

You actually can use this in the /usr/src/linux-kernel-version

But you just want to make sure to run: `make olddefconfig` to update with new options/safe defaults before running the compiling make commands documented in the Gentoo Handbook.

Watch mental outlaws videos on configuring the kernel (one is more in depth than the others). Make notes on the options he changes and actually research the specific flags he configures in the handbook.

At some point you can adjust the number of threads the kernel can use, which apparently defaults to a high number. Your Ryzen has 24 threads, but you can find out specifically by running

```
grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo
```

Or:

```
lscpu
```

ANd looking at the "Thread(s) per core" section.
