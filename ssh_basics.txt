Due to there being a lot to cover with ssh, I thought I might further expand upon the subject with links to certain articles for future reference.

The ~/.ssh directory has many features I was not aware of when first learning about ssh. This includes such things as its own config file (which contains a list of all hosts and which keys they should point to). An example one looks like this:

Host gitlab.com
    Hostname gitlab.com
    User z3rOR0ne
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/privatekey1
    IdentitiesOnly yes
Host github.com
    Hostname github.com
    User tomit4
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/privatekey2
    IdentitiesOnly yes

As you can see, this will point to different privatekeys that can be used with either github or gitlab respectively.

As you are already aware from the ssh_basics_gh.txt instructions. You can generate a basic ssh key like so:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_comment"

This will start the key generation process including a prompt for a password if necessary (highly recommended, although admittedly when used with git it can get annoying if multiple repositories are being pushed to)

So far in my learning journey, I have only utilized ssh as a way of securely accessing my various git repositories, but it's major use is to remotely log into servers. I have provided you (oh future self), with a curled file called ssh_linode.html, which should hopefully give you an idea of how to get started with this (link also below).
