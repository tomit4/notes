The following covers the basic installation instructions and basic command line syntax for utilizing docker.

Install Docker and Docker-compose:

sudo pacman -S docker
sudo pacman -S docker-compose

Start Docker by Default on Startup:

sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.service

Check Docker version:

sudo docker version

And info:

sudo docker info

Run Docker without root:

sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
reboot (required to take effect)

Search for a Docker Image:

docker search [name]

docker search nginx (an example)

Install a docker image:

docker pull hello-world (a simple package that tests if docker is working properly)

And run that Docker image:

docker run hello-world

Monitor Docker:

docker container ls

To see a list of all the Docker images installed:

docker images

To see the CPU RAM and network usage of the running images:

docker stats

To see Docker's network configuration:

docker network ls

To remove docker containers type:

docker container prune (careful, removes them all)
docker container -r <container_id>

You'll still need to remove their corresponding images though, so:

docker images prune (again, removes them all)
docker rmi <container name or id>
