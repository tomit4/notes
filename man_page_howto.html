<P>This HOWTO explains what you should bear in mind when you are going
to write on-line documentation -- a so-called man page -- that you want
to make accessible via the <CODE>man</CODE>(1) command. Throughout this
HOWTO, a manual entry is simply referred to as a man page, regardless of
actual length and without sexist intention. </P>

<P><A NAME="q1"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">1) A few thoughts on documentation</FONT></STRONG></A>
</P>

<P>Why do we write documentation? Silly question. Because we want others
to be able to use our program, library function or whatever we have written
and made available. But writing documentation is not all there is to it:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Documentation must be accessible. If it is hidden in some non-standard
place where the documentation-related tools will not find it -- how can it
serve its purpose?</LI>

<LI>Documentation must be reliable and accurate. There is nothing more annoying
than having program behaviour and documentation disagree. Users will curse
you, send you hate mail and throw your work into the bit bucket, with the
firm intent to never install anything written by that jerk again.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The historical and well known way documentation is accessed on UNIX
is via the man(1) command. This HOWTO describes what you have to do to
write a man page that will be correctly processed by the documentation-
related tools. The most important of these tools are <CODE>man</CODE>(1), <CODE>xman</CODE>(1x),
<CODE>apropos</CODE>(1), <CODE>makewhatis</CODE>(8) and <CODE>catman</CODE>(8). Reliability and accuracy of the
information are, of course, up to you. But even in this respect you will
find <A HREF="#q9">some ideas below</A> that help you avoid some common
glitches. </P>

<P><A NAME="q2"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">2) How are man pages accessed? </FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>You need to know the precise mechanism for acccessing man pages in
order to give your man page the right name and install it in the right
place. Each man page should be categorized in a specific section, denoted by
a single character. The most common sections under Linux, and their human
readable names, are: </P>

<PRE>Section The human readable name
   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.
   8    System administration tools that only root can execute.
   9    Another (Linux specific) place for kernel routine documentation.
   n    (Deprecated) New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate section.
   o    (Deprecated) Old documentation, that may be kept for a grace period.
   l    (Deprecated) Local documentation referring to this particular system.
</PRE>

<P>The name of the man page's source file (the input to the formatting
system) is the name of the command, function or file name, followed by
a dot, followed by the section character. If you write the documentation on the format
of the `passwd' file you have to name the source file `passwd.5'. Here
we also have an example of a file name that is the same as a command name.
There might be even a library subroutine named passwd. Sectioning is the
usual way to resolve these ambiguities: The command description is found
in the file `passwd.1' and the hypothetical library subroutine in `passwd.3'.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Sometimes additional characters are appended and the file
name looks for example like `xterm.1x' or `wish.1tk'. The intent is to
indicate that this is documentation for an X Window program or a Tk application,
respectively. Some manual browsers can make use of this additional information.
For example xman will use `xterm(x)' and `wish(tk)' in the list of available
documentation. </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P>Please do not use the n, o and l sections; according to the File System
Standard these sections are deprecated. Stick to the numeric sections.
Beware of name clashes with existing programs, functions or file names.
It is certainly a bad idea to write yet another editor and call it ed,
sed (for smart ed) or red (for Rocky's ed). By making sure your program's
name is unique, you avoid having someone execute your program but read someone
else's man page, or vice versa.</P>

<P>Now we know the name to give our file. The next decision is the directory
in which it will finally be installed (say, when the user runs `<CODE>make install</CODE>' for
your package.) On Linux, all man pages are below directories listed 
in the environment variable MANPATH. The doc-related tools use MANPATH
in the same way the shell uses PATH to locate executables. In fact, MANPATH
has the same format as PATH. Each contains a colon-separated list of directories
(with the exception that MANPATH does not allow empty fields and relative
pathnames -- it uses absolute names only.) If MANPATH is not set or not exported,
a default will be used that contains at least the /usr/man directory. To
speed up the search and to keep directories small, the directories specified
by MANPATH (the so-called base directories) contain a bunch of subdirectories
named `man&lt;s&gt;' where &lt;s&gt; stands for the one-character section designator
introduced in the <a href="#q2">table above</a>. Not all of the sections may be represented
by a subdirectory because there simply is no reason to keep an empty `mano'
subdirectory. However, there may be directories named `cat&lt;s&gt;', `dvi&lt;s&gt;'
and `ps&lt;s&gt;' which hold documentation that is ready to display or
print. More on this later. The only other file in any base directory should
be a file named `whatis'. The purpose and creation of this file will also
be described under <a href="#q12">paragraph 12)</a>. The safest way to have a man page for
section &lt;s&gt; installed in the right place is to put it in the directory
/usr/man/man&lt;s&gt;. A good <CODE>Makefile</CODE>, however, will allow the user to
chose a base directory, by means of a <CODE>make</CODE> variable, <VAR>MANDIR</VAR>, say. Most
of the GNU packages can be configured with the <CODE>--prefix=/what/ever</CODE> option.
The manuals will then be installed under the base directory /what/ever/man.
I suggest you also provide a way to do something similar. </P>

<P>With the advent of the Linux
File System Standard (FS-Stnd), things became more complicated. The
FS-Stnd 1.2 states that</P>

<UL>
<li>&quot;Provisions must be made in the structure of /usr/man to support
manual pages which are written in different (or multiple) languages.&quot;
</li>
</UL>

<P>This is achieved by introducing another directory level that distinguishes
between different languages. Quoting again from FS-Stnd 1.2: </P>

<UL>
<li>&quot;This naming of language subdirectories of /usr/man is based on
Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes the locale identification
string -- the most well accepted method to describe a cultural environment.
The &lt;locale&gt; string is: &lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;character-set&gt;][,&lt;version&gt;]&quot;</li>
</UL>

<P>(See the FS-Stnd for a few common &lt;locale&gt; strings.) According
to these guidelines, we have our man pages in /usr/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man[1-9lno].
The formatted versions should then be in /usr/man/&lt;locale&gt;/cat[1-9lno]
of course, otherwise we could only provide them for a single locale. HOWEVER,
I can not recommend switching to that structure at this time. The FS-Stnd
1.2 also allows that </P>

<UL>
<li>&quot;Systems which use a unique language and code set for all manual
pages may omit the &lt;locale&gt; substring and store all manual pages
in &lt;mandir&gt;. For example, systems which only have English manual
pages coded with ASCII, may store manual pages (the <CODE>man[1-9]</CODE> directories)
directly in /usr/man. (That is the traditional circumstance and arrangement
in fact.)&quot;</li>
</UL>

<P>I would not switch until all tools (like xman, tkman, info and many
others that read man pages) can cope with the new structure. </P>

<P><A NAME="q3"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">3) How should a formatted man page
look?</FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Let me present you an example. Below I will explain it in detail. If
you read this as plain text it will not show the different typefaces (<STRONG>bold

<STRONG>NAME
</STRONG>     foo - frobnicate the bar library

<STRONG>SYNOPSIS
</STRONG>     <STRONG>foo [-bar] [-c</STRONG> <EM>config-file</EM> <STRONG>]</STRONG> <EM>file</EM> <STRONG>...

DESCRIPTION
</STRONG>     <STRONG>foo</STRONG>  frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol
     tables. By default it parses all baz segments and rearranges
     them  in  reverse  order  by time for the <STRONG>xyzzy</STRONG>(1) linker to
     find them. The symdef entry is then compressed using the WBG
     (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.  All files are processed in the
     order specified.

<STRONG>OPTIONS
</STRONG>     -b   Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.

     -c config-file
          Use the alternate system wide  <EM>config-file</EM>  instead  of
          <EM>/etc/foo.conf</EM>.   This overrides any <STRONG>FOOCONF</STRONG> environment
          variable.

     -a   In addition to the baz segments, also parse the  blurfl
          headers.

     -r   Recursive  mode.  Operates  as fast as lightning at the
          expense of a megabyte of virtual memory.

<STRONG>FILES
</STRONG>     <EM>/etc/foo.conf
</EM>          The system wide configuration file. See <STRONG>foo</STRONG>(5) for fur-
          ther details.
     <EM>~/.foorc
</EM>          Per  user  configuration  file.  See <STRONG>foo</STRONG>(5) for further
          details.

<STRONG>ENVIRONMENT
</STRONG>     FOOCONF
          If non-null the full pathname for an  alternate  system
          wide <EM>foo.conf</EM>.  Overridden by the -c option.

<STRONG>DIAGNOSTICS
</STRONG>     The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

     Bad magic number.
          The input file does not look like an archive file.
     Old style baz segments.
          foo  can  only  handle  new  style  baz segments. COBOL
          object libraries are not supported in this version.

<STRONG>BUGS
</STRONG>     The command name should have been chosen more  carefully  to
     reflect its purpose.

</PRE>

<P>Here is the explanation as I promised. </P>

<P><STRONG>The NAME section</STRONG></P>

<P>...is the only required section. Man pages without a name section are
as useful as refrigerators at the north pole. This section also has a
standardized format consisting of a comma-separated list of program or
function names, followed by a dash, followed by a short (usually one
line) description of the functionality the program (or function, or
file) is supposed to provide. By means of <CODE>makewhatis</CODE>(8),
the name sections make it into the <CODE>whatis</CODE> database files.
<CODE>Makewhatis</CODE> is the reason the name section must exist, and
why it must adhere to the format I described. In the <CODE>groff</CODE>
source it must look like</P>

<P>.SH NAME foo \- frobnicate the bar library </P>

<P>The \- is of importance here. The backslash is needed to make the dash
distinct from a hyphenation dash that may appear in either the command
name or the one line description. </P>

<P><STRONG>The SYNOPSIS section</STRONG></P>

<P>...is intended to give a short overview on available program options.
For functions this sections lists corresponding include files and the prototype
so the programmer knows the type and number of arguments as well as the
return type. </P>

<P><STRONG>The DESCRIPTION section </STRONG></P>

<P>...eloquently explains why your sequence of 0s and 1s is worth
anything at all. Here is where you write down all your knowledge. This is
the Hall Of Fame. Win other programmers' and users' admiration by making
this section the source of reliable and detailed information. Explain what
the arguments are for, the file format, what algorithms do the dirty jobs.
</P>

<P><STRONG>The OPTIONS section</STRONG></P>

<P>...gives a description of how each option affects program behaviour.
You knew that, did you not? </P>

<P><STRONG>The FILES section</STRONG></P>

<P>...lists files the program or function uses. For example, it lists
configuration files, startup files, and files the program directly
operates on. It is a good idea to give the full pathname of these files
and to make the install process modify the directory part to match user
preferences: the <CODE>groff</CODE> manuals have a default prefix of
/usr/local, so they reference /usr/local/lib/groff/* by default.
However, if you install using 'make prefix=/opt/gnu' the references in
the man page change to /opt/gnu/lib/groff/*</P>

<P><STRONG>The ENVIRONMENT section </STRONG></P>

<P>...lists all environment variables that affect your program or function
and tells how, of course. Most commonly the variables will hold pathnames,
filenames or default options. </P>

<P><STRONG>The DIAGNOSTICS section</STRONG></P>

<P>...should give an overview of the most common error messages from
your program and how to cope with them. There is no need to explain
system error error messages (from <CODE>perror</CODE>(3)) or fatal
signals (from <CODE>psignal</CODE>(3)) as they can appear during
execution of any program. </P>

<P><STRONG>The BUGS section </STRONG></P>

<P>...should ideally be non-existent. If you are brave, you can describe
here the limitations, known inconveniences and features that others may regard
as misfeatures. If you are not so brave, rename it the TO DO section ;-)
</P>

<P><STRONG>The AUTHOR section</STRONG></P>

<P>...is nice to have in case there are gross errors in the documentation
or program behaviour (Bzzt!) and you want to mail a bug report. </P>

<P><STRONG>The SEE ALSO section</STRONG></P>

<P>...is a list of related man pages in alphabetical order. Conventionally,
it is the last section. You are free to invent other sections if they really
do not fit in one of those described so far. So how exactly did you generate
that man page? I expected that question, here is the source, Luke:</P>

<P><A NAME="q4"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">4) How do I document several programs/functions
in a single man page?</FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Many programs (<CODE>grep</CODE>, <CODE>egrep</CODE>) and functions
(<CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>fprintf</CODE>, ...) are documented in a
single man page. However, these man pages would be quite useless if they
were only accessible under one name. We cannot expect a user to remember
that the <CODE>egrep</CODE> man page is actually the <CODE>grep</CODE>
man page. It is therefore necessary to have the man page available under
different names. You have several possibilities to achieve this: </P>

<OL>
<LI>have identical copies for each name.</LI>
<LI>connect all man pages using hard links.</LI>
<LI>symbolic links pointing to the actual man page.</LI>
<LI>use <CODE>groff</CODE>'s `source' mechanism provided by the
<CODE>.so</CODE> macro.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The first way is obviously a waste of disk space. The second is not
recommended because intelligent versions of the <CODE>catman</CODE> program can save
a lot of work by looking at the the file type or contents. Hard links will
prevent <CODE>catman</CODE> from being clever. (Note that <CODE>catman</CODE>'s purpose is to format all man
pages so they can be displayed quickly.) The third alternative
has a slight drawback: if flexibility is a concern, you have to be aware
that there are file systems that do not support symbolic links. The upshot
of this is that the Best Thing (TM) is using <CODE>groff</CODE>'s source mechanism.
Here is how to do it: If you want to have your man page available under
the names `foo' and `bar' in section 1, then put the man page in foo.1
and have bar.1 look like this: </P>

<P><CODE>.so man1/foo.1</CODE></P>

<P>It is important to specify the <CODE>man1/</CODE> directory part as
well as the file name `foo.1' because when <CODE>groff</CODE> is run by
the browser it will have the manual base directory as its current
working directory (cwd) and <CODE>groff</CODE> interprets
<CODE>.so</CODE> arguments relative to the cwd. </P>

<P><A NAME="q5"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">5) Which macro package should I use?
</FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>There are a number of macro packages especially designed for use in
writing man pages. Usually they are in the groff macro directory /usr/lib/groff/tmac.
The file names are <CODE>tmac.</CODE>&lt;something&gt;, where &lt;something&gt;
is the argument to groff's -m option. Groff will use <CODE>tmac.</CODE>&lt;something&gt;
when it is given the `<CODE>-m</CODE> &lt;something&gt;' option. Often the
blank between `<CODE>-m</CODE>' and `&lt;something&gt;' is omitted so we may
say `<CODE>groff -man</CODE>' when we are formatting man pages using the <CODE>tmac.an
</CODE>macro package. That is the reason for the strange name `tmac.an'. Besides
tmac.an there is another popular macro package, <CODE>tmac.doc</CODE>, which
originated at the University of California at Berkeley. Many BSD man pages
use it and it seems that UCB has made it its standard for documentation.
The <CODE>tmac.doc</CODE> macros are much more flexible but alas, there are
manual browsers that will not use them but always call <CODE>groff -man</CODE>.
For example, all <CODE>xman</CODE> programs I have seen will screw up on man
pages requiring <CODE>tmac.doc</CODE>. So do yourself a favor: use <CODE>tmac.an</CODE>
-- use of any other macro package is considered harmful. <CODE>tmac.andoc
</CODE>is a pseudo macro package that takes a look at the source and then
loads either <CODE>tmac.an</CODE> or <CODE>tmac.doc</CODE>. Actually, any man page
browser should use it but to this point,  not all of them do, so it is best we
cling to ye olde <CODE>tmac.an</CODE>. Anything I tell you from now on and
concerning macros only holds true for <CODE>tmac.an</CODE>. If you want to
use the <CODE>tmac.doc</CODE> macros anyway, here is a pointer to detailed
information on how to use them:
<A HREF="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi">http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi</A>.
There is a searchable index form on the page. Enter <CODE>groff_mdoc</CODE>
and it will find you <CODE>groff_mdoc(7)</CODE>, a tutorial sampler for writing
BSD man pages. Some distros (I'm told) also come with
mdoc(7), mdoc.samples(7) and groff_man(7).</P>

The definitive dope for <CODE>troff</CODE>, with all macros explained, is
the <EM>Troff User's Manual</EM>, available as
<A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/troff.ps">PostScript (ps, 760K)</A> or

by Jospeh F. Ossanna and Brian W. Kernighan, revised November 1992.
AT&amp;T Bell Labs have made it publicly available.
Do not forget to check out the late great
<A HREF="http://www.kohala.com/start/">W. Richard Steven's
homepage</A> (famous for <EM>Unix Network Programming</EM> as well as
the <EM>TCP/IP Illustrated</EM> trilogy),
who also has a list of
<A HREF="http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/troff.html">Troff Resources</A>
including <CODE>tbl</CODE>, <CODE>eqn</CODE>, <CODE>pic</CODE> and other filters.

<P><A NAME="q6"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">6) What preprocessors may I use? </FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Groff comes with at least three preprocessors, <CODE>tbl</CODE>,
<CODE>eqn</CODE>, and <CODE>pic</CODE> (on some systems they are named
<CODE>gtbl</CODE>, <CODE>geqn</CODE> and <CODE>gpic</CODE>.) Their
purpose is to translate preprocessor macros and their data to regular
troff input. <CODE>Tbl</CODE> is a table preprocessor, <CODE>eqn</CODE>
is an equations/maths preprocessor and <CODE>pic</CODE> is a picture
preprocessor. Please refer to the man pages for more information on what
functionality they provide. To put it in a nutshell: do not write man
pages requiring <EM>any</EM> preprocessor. Eqn will generally produce
terrible output for typewriter-like devices, unfortunately the type of
device 99% of all man pages are viewed on (well, at least I do). For
example, XAllocColor.3x uses a few formulas with exponentiation. Due to
the nature of typewriter-like devices, the exponent will be on the same
line as the base. N to the power of two appears as `N2'.
<CODE>Tbl</CODE> should be avoided because all xman programs I have seen
fail on them. Xman 3.1.6 uses the following command to format man pages,
e.g. signal(7):</P>

<P><CODE>gtbl /usr/man/man7/signal.7 | geqn | gtbl | groff -Tascii -man /tmp/xmana01760
2&gt; /dev/null</CODE></P>

<P>which screws up for sources using <CODE>gtbl</CODE>, because
<CODE>gtbl</CODE> output is fed again into <CODE>gtbl</CODE>. The effect
is a man page without your table. I do not know if it is a bug or a
feature that <CODE>gtbl</CODE> chokes on its own output or if xman could
be a little smarter and not use <CODE>gtbl</CODE> twice. Furthermore,
some systems use <CODE>grog</CODE> to determine what options to pass to
groff. Unfortunately grog sometimes guesses wrong and recommends
<CODE>groff -t</CODE> when in fact <CODE>tbl</CODE> must not be used.

We are basically left with two workarounds for tables:

<OL><LI>Format the table yourself manually and put it between .nf and
.fi lines so that it will be left unformatted. You will not have bold and
italics this way but this beats having your table swallowed any
day.</LI>

<LI>Use any <CODE>tbl</CODE> macros you like but distribute the
<CODE>tbl</CODE> output instead of the input. There is however this
quirk with <CODE>grog</CODE> who thinks that any file containing a line
starting with <CODE>.TS</CODE> requires <CODE>tbl</CODE>.
<CODE>Tbl</CODE> output for some reason unbeknownst to me still contains
<CODE>.TS</CODE> and <CODE>.TE</CODE>. It seems you can simply remove
them and have the result still look okay. YMMV, so please test this with
your particular man page.</LI></OL>

<P>I have yet to see a man page requiring <CODE>pic</CODE>
preprocessing. But I would not like it. As you can see above,
<CODE>xman</CODE> will not use it and <CODE>groff</CODE> will certainly
do the funky wadakiki on the input.</P>

<P><A NAME="q7"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">7) Should I distribute source and/or
already formatted documentation? </FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Let me give the pros (+) and cons (-) of a few selected possibilities:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Source only:<BR>
+ smaller distribution package.<BR>
- inaccessible on systems without <CODE>groff</CODE>.</LI>

<LI>Uncompressed formatted only:<BR>
+ accessible even on systems without <CODE>groff</CODE>. <BR>
- the user cannot generate a dvi or postscript file. <BR>
- waste of disk space on systems that also handle compressed pages.</LI>

<LI>Compressed formatted only: <BR>
+ accessible even on systems without <CODE>groff</CODE>. <BR>
- the user cannot generate a dvi or postscript file.<BR>
- which compression format would you use? .Z? .z? .gz? All of them?</LI>

<LI>Source and uncompressed formatted:<BR>
+ accessible even on systems without <CODE>groff</CODE>.<BR>
- larger distribution package<BR>
- some systems may expect compressed formatted man pages.<BR>
- redundant information on systems equipped with <CODE>groff</CODE>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>IMHO it is best to distribute source only. The argument that it is
inaccessible on systems without <CODE>groff </CODE>does not matter. The
500+ man pages of the Linux Documentation Project are source only. The
man pages of XFree86 are source only. The man pages from the FSF are
source only. In fact, I have rarely seen software distributed with
formatted man pages. If any sysadmin is really concerned about having
man pages accessible then he also has <CODE>groff</CODE> installed. </P>

<P><A NAME="q8"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">8) What are the font conventions?
</FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>First of all: do not use direct font operators like <CODE>\fB</CODE>,
<CODE>\fP</CODE> etc. Use macros which take arguments. This way you
avoid a common glitch: forgetting the font change at the end of the word
and having the bold or italic extend up to the next font change. Believe
me, it happens more often than you think. The <CODE>tmac.an</CODE>
macros provide the following type faces: </P>

<UL>
<li>.B Bold </li>

<li>.BI Bold alternating with italics </li>

<li>.BR Bold alternating with Roman </li>

<li>.I Italics </li>

<li>.IB Italics alternating with bold </li>

<li>.IR Italics alternating with Roman </li>

<li>.RB Roman alternating with bold</li>

<li>.RI Roman alternating with italics </li>

<li>.SM Small (scaled 9/10 of the regular size)</li>

<li>.SB Small bold (<EM>not</EM> small alternating with bold) </li>
</UL>

<P>X alternating with Y means that the odd arguments are typeset in X while
the even arguments are typeset in Y. For example </P>

<UL>
<li>.BI &quot;Arg 1 is Bold, &quot; &quot;Arg 2 is Italics, &quot; &quot;and
Bold, &quot; &quot;and Italics.&quot; </li>
</UL>

<P>The double quotes are needed to include white space into an argument;
without them, no white space appears between the alternating typefaces.
In fact, you will only need the macros for alternating typefaces in
cases where you <EM>want</EM>
to avoid white space between typeface changes.
So much for what is available. Here is how you should make use of the different
typefaces: (portions shamelessly stolen from man(7)) </P>

<P>Although there are many arbitrary conventions for man pages in the UNIX
world, the existence of several hundred Linux-specific man pages defines
our standards: For functions, the arguments are always specified using
italics, even in the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest of the function is
specified in bold: </P>

<UL>
<li>.BI &quot;myfunction(int &quot; argc &quot;, char **&quot; argv ); </li>
</UL>

<P>Filenames are always in italics, except in the SYNOPSIS section, where
included files are in bold. So you should use </P>

<UL>
<li>.I /usr/include/stdio.h </li>
</UL>

<P>and </P>

<UL>
<li>.B #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; </li>
</UL>

<P>Special macros, which are usually in upper case, are in bold: </P>

<UL>
<li>.B MAXINT </li>
</UL>

<P>When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold. This
list usually uses the .TP (paragraph with hanging tag) macro as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<li>.TP<BR>
.B EBADF<BR>
.I fd is not a valid file descriptor.<BR>
.TP <BR>
.B EINVAL <BR>
.I fd is unsuitable for reading <BR>
</li>
</UL>

<P>Any reference to another man page (or to the subject of the current
man page) is in bold. If the manual section number is given, it is given
in roman, without any spaces: </P>

<UL>
<li>.BR man (7)</li>
</UL>

<P>Acronyms look best when typeset in small type face. So I recommend </P>

<UL>
<li>.SM UNIX </li>

<li>.SM ASCII</li>

<li>.SM TAB </li>

<li>.SM NFS</li>

<li>.SM LALR(1)</li>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="q9"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">9) Polishing your man page</FONT></STRONG></A>
</P>

<P>Following are some guidelines that increase reliability, readability
and 'formatability' of your documentation.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Test examples to make sure they work (use cut and paste to give your shell the
exact wording from the man page). Copy the output of your command into your
man page, do not just type what you <EM>think</EM> your program will print.</LI>

<LI>Proof read, ispell, and have someone else read it, especially if you are
not a native English speaker. The HOWTO you are reading has 
passed the latter test (special thanks to Michael Miller for a
particularly heroic contribution! All the remaining
rough edges are entirely my fault).
Additional volunteers are always welcome.</LI>

<LI>Test your man page: Does <CODE>groff</CODE> complain when you format
your man page? It is nice to have the <CODE>groff</CODE> command line in
a comment. Does the <CODE>man</CODE>(1) command complain when you call
<CODE>man yourprog</CODE>? Does it produce the expected result? Will
<CODE>xman</CODE>(1x) and <CODE>tkman</CODE>(1tk) cope with your manual?
XFree86 3.1 has xman 3.1.6 - X11R6, it will try to uncompress using <BR>
<CODE>gzip -c -d &lt; %s &gt; %s <BR> zcat &lt; %s &gt; %s </CODE></LI>

<LI>Will <CODE>makewhatis</CODE>(8) be able to extract the one-line
description from the NAME section?</LI>

<li>Translate your man page to HTML format using <CODE>rman</CODE> from
  <A href="http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/">http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/</a>,
  and view the result with a a set of web browsers (netscape, mozilla, opera, lynx, ...)
  Check that the cross-references among your man pages work as hyperlinks in the
  generated HTML.  If your software package has a web site, post its man pages
  there, and keep them up-to-date.</li>
<li>The <code>rman</code> utility can also translate man pages into LaTeX, RTF, SGML, and other
formats; check these out if you want to incorporate your man pages in a book or
other larger document.</li>
<li>Try translating your man page to HTML using <code>man2html</code>, which has been part of the
  Linux man package since man-1.4. The <code>man2html</code> utility is a less ambitious translator than
  <code>rman</code>, but almost every Linux user has it already, so it is worth making sure that
  <code>man2html</code> does not choke on your man page.</li>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="q10"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">10) How do I get a plain text man page
without all that ^H^_ stuff? </FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Have a look at <CODE>col</CODE>(1), because <CODE>col </CODE>can filter out backspace
sequences. Just in case you cannot wait that long: </P>

<P><CODE>funnyprompt$ groff -t -e -mandoc -Tascii manpage.1 | col -bx &gt;
manpage.txt</CODE></P>

<P>The <CODE>-t</CODE> and <CODE>-e</CODE> switches tell
<CODE>groff</CODE> to preprocess using <CODE>tbl</CODE> and
<CODE>eqn</CODE>. This is overkill for man pages that do not require
preprocessing but it does no harm apart from a few CPU cycles wasted. On
the other hand, not using <CODE>-t</CODE> when it is actually required
does harm: the table is terribly formatted. You can even find out (well,
&quot;guess&quot; is a better word) what command is needed to format a
certain <CODE>groff</CODE> document (not just man pages) by issuing </P>

<P><CODE>funnyprompt$ grog /usr/man/man7/signal.7<BR>
groff -t -man /usr/man/man7/signal.7
</CODE></P>

<P>&quot;Grog&quot; stands for &quot;GROff Guess&quot;, and it does what
it says--guess. If it were perfect we would not need options any more.
I have seen it guess incorrectly on macro packages and on preprocessors.
Here is a little perl script I wrote that can delete the page headers
and footers, thereby saving you a few pages (and mother nature a tree)
when printing long and elaborate man pages. Save it in a file named
<CODE>strip-headers</CODE> &amp; chmod 755. </P>

<PRE>    #!/usr/bin/perl -wn
    #  make it slurp the whole file at once:
    undef $/;
    #  delete first header:
    s/^\n*.*\n+//;
    #  delete last footer:
    s/\n+.*\n+$/\n/g;
    #  delete page breaks:
    s/\n\n+[^ \t].*\n\n+(\S+).*\1\n\n+/\n/g;
    #  collapse two or more blank lines into a single one:
    s/\n{3,}/\n\n/g;
    #  see what is left...
    print;
</PRE>

<P>You have to use it as the first filter after the <CODE>man</CODE>
command as it relies on the number of newlines being output by
<CODE>groff</CODE>. For example: </P>

<P><CODE>funnyprompt$ man bash | strip-headers | col -bx &gt; bash.txt</CODE>
</P>

<P><A NAME="q11"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">11) How do I get a high quality PostScript

<P>Print or view that using your favorite PostScript printer/viewer.

<P><A NAME="q12"><STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">12) How do I get `apropos' and `whatis'
to work? </FONT></STRONG></A></P>

<P>Suppose you wonder what compilers are installed on your system and how
these can be invoked. To answer this (frequently asked) question you say
</P>

<P><CODE>funnyprompt$ apropos compiler<BR>
f77 (1) - Fortran 77 compiler <BR>
gcc (1) - GNU C and C++ compiler<BR>
pc (1) - Pascal compiler
</CODE></P>

<P><CODE>Apropos</CODE> and <CODE>whatis</CODE> are used to quickly
report which man page has information on a certain topic. Both programs
search a number of files named `whatis' that may be found in each of the
manual base directories. As previously stated, the whatis data base files
contain a one line entry for any man page in the respective directory
tree. In fact, that line is exactly the NAME section (to be precise:
joined on one line and with hyphenation removed; note that the section
is mentioned within parentheses). The whatis database files are created
with the <CODE>makewhatis</CODE>(8) program. There are several versions
around, so please refer to the man page to determine what options are
available. In order for <CODE>makewhatis</CODE> to be able to extract
the NAME sections correctly it is important that you, the manual writer,
adhere to the NAME section format described under <A HREF="#q3">question
3)</A>. The differences between <CODE>apropos</CODE> and
<CODE>whatis</CODE> are simply where in the line they look, and what
they are looking for. <CODE>Apropos</CODE> (which is equivalent to
<CODE>man -k</CODE>) searches the argument string anywhere on the line,
whereas <CODE>whatis</CODE> (equivalent to <CODE>man -f</CODE>) tries to
match a complete command name only on the part before the dash.
Consequently, `<CODE>whatis cc</CODE>' will report if there is a
<CODE>cc</CODE> manual and remain quiet for <CODE>gcc</CODE>.</P>
