Plans for NAS.

Perhaps look at 2J Synology line of NASs.
Do NOT do a full Hypervisor server.

- Build a small UNRAID server.
- Buy 3 spinning disks (same size drive).
- One parity drive, two backup drives.
- Buy 1 NVME M2 hard drive around 2TB worth.
- Use NVME for VM (docker).
- All long term storage goes on spinning disk
- Buy 5400 RPM drives if that makes it cheaper (makes speed slower)
- CAT 5 or CAT 6 network.
- Buy 16GB of RAM or more.
- Intel/AMD with built-in graphics card.
- FreeNAS.
