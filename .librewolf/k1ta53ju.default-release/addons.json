This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest. Containers Supported","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nAs of Firefox 86, strict mode is not supported at this time due to missing APIs to handle the Total Cookie Protection. Also as of Firefox 103, standard mode has also enabled Total Cookie Protection. Use 'strict' mode if using pre-86, use standard mode for versions 86-102, or from version 103+ use the custom configuration and set cookie to 'cross site tracking cookies' option (not the cross-site cookies).\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.\n\nFAQ: Does OneTab work on the Android version of Firefox?\nA: The latest version Includes experimental support for the upcoming Firefox Android release. Please note that Android currently does not allow you to save to OneTab any \"discarded\" tabs. A discarded tab is one that looks like an open tab in your list of tabs, but that Firefox does not consider active and is not stored in RAM. This is a bug in Firefox for Android that looks likely to be resolved by Mozilla within a few months.","weeklyDownloads":2552,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1682,"reviewCount":1093,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1696342139000},{"id":"{79b2e4de-8fb4-4ccc-b9f6-362ac2fb74b2}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/851/851503-32.png?modified=1648138451","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/851/851503-64.png?modified=1648138451","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/851/851503-128.png?modified=1648138451"},"name":"Measure-it","version":"2.2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3155605/measure_it-2.2.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/tsl143/measure-it","supportURL":"https://github.com/tsl143/measure-it","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measure-it/","description":"Draw a ruler across any webpage to check the width, height, or alignment of page elements in pixels.","fullDescription":"Draw a ruler across any webpage to check the width, height, or alignment of page elements in pixels.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nMac - Command+Shift+O\nWindows/Linux - Alt+Shift+M\nThis can be changed from Add-on preferences.\nFeatures\n\n    Fast\n    Simple\n    Customizable UI/shortcuts from preferences\n\n\nNote - This may not work on addons.mozilla.org","weeklyDownloads":403,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Trishul","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10424937/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187854.png?modified=1622132811","width":700,"height":352,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187854.jpg?modified=1622132811","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":268}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/tsl143?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.4492,"reviewCount":57,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/measure-it/reviews/","updateDate":1562054744000},{"id":"CanvasBlocker@kkapsner.de","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-32.png?modified=1581849561","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-64.png?modified=1581849561","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/534/534930-128.png?modified=1581849561"},"name":"CanvasBlocker","version":"1.9","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4097901/canvasblocker-1.9.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker/","supportURL":null,"amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/","description":"Alters some JS APIs to prevent fingerprinting.","fullDescription":"This add-on allows users to prevent websites from using some Javascript APIs to fingerprint them.

Some websites use this track to only offer services when the tab is active. By installing this extension a small script is injected into every webpage which overwrites the \"document.visibilityState\", and \"document.hidden\" properties to pretend the tab is always in the active state (document.visibilityState = 'visible' and document.hidden = false).\n\nThis is useful for the webpages that check your visibility state before loading resources like many music webpages. By installing this extension even if the page is opened in the background page, the player will start immediately like the page is loaded on an active tab.\n\nSupported Trackings:\ndocument.mozHidden (only on Firefox browser)\ndocument.webkitHidden (only on Chromium browsers)\n\nSupported Events:\n1. visibilitychange\n2. webkitvisibilitychange (only on Chromium browsers)\n3. mozvisibilitychange (only on Firefox browser)\n4. blur (some websites require the user to keep the tab focused)\n5. mouseleave (some websites use this method to make sure the user pointer is inside the window)\n\nNotes:\nAt the moment there is no exception list, so the extension injects the script on all HTTP and local HTML pages. You need to disable the extension from the options page if you need to bypass the default always active behavior. On Chromium browsers, you can also limit the script injection to a few hostnames by using the right-click context menu item called \"This Can Read and Change Site Data\" over the browser action button.","weeklyDownloads":246,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Brian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15062319/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/226/226673.png?modified=1622135046","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/226/226673.jpg?modified=1622135046","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.0455,"reviewCount":18,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/always-visible/reviews/","updateDate":1694176309000},{"id":"overbitewx@floodgap.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-32.2b26add4b394.png","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-64.d144b50f2bb8.png","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/static-server/img/addon-icons/default-128.452018499894.png"},"name":"OverbiteWX","version":"0.4.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/846090/overbitewx-0.4.1.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/overbitewx/","description":"Re-enables the Gopher protocol in Firefox 56 and above, allowing you to enter Gopher URLs and click on Gopher links.

In this version, your requests are sent to the Floodgap Public Gopher Proxy, which converts the Gopher menu and documents to HTML and HTTP. Future versions will allow a choice of proxy, and eventually restore direct connections to Gopher servers when the API is finally available from Mozilla. Thanks for your patience and indulgence while we wait for WebExtensions to become more useful and complete for the next generation of Firefox addons.\n\nNEW: If you would like to try an experimental Gopher add-on allowing direct connection to Gopher servers using a native component, try our experimental companion add-on, OverbiteNX. OverbiteNX requires a separate open-source component be installed on your computer. OverbiteWX will only use supported WebExtensions APIs.\n\nTo set up OverbiteWX:\n\n    Install the addon.\n    Enter any Gopher URL or click any Gopher link starting with gopher://\n    Firefox will pop up a window saying you must select an application to view that link. OverbiteWX will be in the list. Select it, check the box to remember this choice if you desire (strongly recommended, or you will get this window every time), and click Open Link.\n    The Gopher site you have selected will be rendered by the Floodgap Gopher proxy.\n\n\nYou can always choose another Gopher handler from Preferences, Applications. If you uninstall OverbiteWX, you will be asked to choose a new Gopher handler on the next Gopher site you visit.\n\nThanks for using
