# This file was generated using redirection, (page 41 of the bash.pdf). Because the file redirection was successful(status code 1), it created the above output from the ls command.

# ls > dirlist.txt 2>&1

# There are two syntactically more concise formats to this:

# ls &> dirlist.txt
# ls >& dirlist.txt

# You can also append using similar syntax, by simply adding another redirection operator character (>). The following would
yield an error output (see below).

# lsh &>> dirlist.txt
# lsh >>& dirlist.txt

########################
# The following was appended to demonstrate that standard error messages(2) will also be redirected when using the 2>&1 syntax:

# lsh >> dirlist.txt 2>&1

bash: lsh: command not found

# Just as an aside (because it's unlikely you'll need this syntax), the pipe operator (|) used in conjection with the redirection operator (>) will attempt to send the output of the command to the file even if the file exists.
