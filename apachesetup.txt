Install Apache on Arch Linux

We must first begin by installing Apache with the following command:

sudo pacman -S apache

Start the Apache service with the following command:

sudo systemctl start httpd

To edit the main Apache configuration file for one or many websites, according to your preference, open the configuration file located in the following directory:

sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

In order to test the installation, create a test HTML file in the following directory with the command below:

sudo nano /srv/http/index.html

Insert the following HTML code in the empty file then save and exit:

<html>
<body>
<h1>CONGRATULATIONS</h1>
<h2>You have just installed Apache on your Arch Linux Server</h2>
</body>
</html>

You can now verify that Apache is installed correctly by typing http:// and your IP address in your browser.

http://YOUR.IP.ADD.RESS

To get your serverâ€™s public IP address, type the following command:

curl icanhazip.com
