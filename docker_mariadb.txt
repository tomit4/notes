# Setting up a Docker MariaDB instance isn't too difficult, based off of Technotes yt channel, it can be done as follows:

# From the terminal, enter:

docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test --name mydbcontainer -d mariadb

docker exec -it mydbcontainer -u root -p (enter password test)

# You will then see a classic CLI mariadb instance, go ahead and quit using \q, then:

docker inspect mydbcontainer

# This will show you a JSON like object that will include the IP addresss, copy it, and use it in the following command from your home machine command line:

mariadb -h 172.17.0.2 root -p (and enter password test again)

This will allow you to remote into the docker instance and use the mariadb without having to execute docker outright like above.
