# Running PostgreSQL on Artix/Runit system has been somewhat of a hassle, so here is a way of logging in quickly

sudo -iu postgres (logs in as postgres, note you can't do this with doas)

you can initialize a new database by invoking initdb

initdb --locale=en_US.UTF-8 -E UTF8 -D /var/lib/postgres/data

As long as the final line of output reads a command, invoke it like so:

pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l logfile start

If the process is already running, then you'll need to stop it by invoking it through ruhit's sv command:

doas sv stop postgresql

This should stop the port from being busy and then you can run the above pg_ctl command again

Now from the postgres account you can log into postgres, but if you want to create access for your main user, invoke this as postgres:

createuser --interactive

It will then prompt you for the name and then also if you want to grant that user root privileges

You can also createa  new database

createdb myDatabaseName
