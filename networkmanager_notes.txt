There are a couple files you can create in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/

That help with privacy/security. One is randomizing your mac address.

touch /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi_rand_mac.conf

And in there write:

```
[device-mac-randomization]
# "yes" is already the default for scanning
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=yes

[connection-mac-randomization]
# Randomize MAC for every ethernet connection
ethernet.cloned-mac-address=random
# Generate a random MAC for each Wi-Fi and associate the two permanently.
wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable

#[main]
# OpenResolv to get it to work with wireguard
#rc-manager=resolvconf
```

The other thing you can do is not have it ping archlinux every few minutes to test connectivity...

touch /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/20-connectivity.conf

```
[connectivity]
enabled=false
```

Lastly for /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf, you can set some basic things up, the main one is not having it set dns (note that if you have dns=none, some things might break unless you have another dns resolver setup, this field allows NetworkManager to set DNS in /etc/resolv.conf, so you may want to comment out that field depending on your settings).

```
# Configuration file for NetworkManager.
# See "man 5 NetworkManager.conf" for details.
[main]
plugins=keyfile
hostname-mode=none
dns=none
```
