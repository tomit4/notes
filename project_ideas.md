## PROJECT IDEAS

This is just a simple document where I can scratchpad some ideas for personal
projects.

### HTML Placeholder Website

Very much like the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
website, this would provide a basic fake API. Instead of returning JSON,
however, this would return HTML data. The idea behind this is that this API
would be used to test with a hypermedia rendering library like [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

Keep in mind how JSON Placeholder is created, look at its minimal dependencies,
like [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), [tinyhttp](https://tinyhttp.v1rtl.site/), and even though it's less relevant, it is still of interest to take a look at [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb).

### Dev Dictionary

This idea takes inspiration from [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) as well as [Tech-Wiki](https://tech-wiki.net/index.php/Main_Page). While Urban Dictionary actually does have some contributions that deal with tech like [this one on http](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=HTTP), this idea concentrates the subject matter into a single technical dictionary, emphasizing short quick and concise definitions that give the user a very fast overview of what the term means.
