Of course you can just exit each window one by one (but this is cumbersome), to
kill all windows and the session:
Ctrl + x + s + x
OR
Ctrl + x + : + kill-session

If you didn't kill the window this way, the session is still open and you can
"attach" to that session like so:
tmux attach

PLUGINS
-tmux-resurrect: saves session of tmux even after reboot
Ctrl + x + Ctrl + s (saves session)
Ctrl + x + Ctrl + r (resurrects last session)

NOTE: saved session files are found in ~/.tmux/resurrect/
If you wish to restore a previous resurrect "save point", go to this directory
and:
ln -sf <file_name>.txt last
This will soft link the last file (resurrect looks here) to whichever point you
wish to go to (inspect file contents to find out).
