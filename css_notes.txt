There is a lot to CSS, SASS, etc, so alot of these notes will be in reference to further documentation you can find online.
Eventually very specific tools that we reuse will be noted either here or in a separate file.

One of the best resources you can go to for CSS is Kevin Powell on youtube:

And also CSS-Tricks.com:
