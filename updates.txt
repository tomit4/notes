Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space:
tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

install vrms (because we all need a tiny richard stallman complaining about which packages on our computer actually aren't libre)

paru vrms

install colordiff:

doas pacman -S colordiff

remove mplayer (stopped working, use mpv instead)

doas pacman -Rs mplayer

Note: You may need to add the postgresql runit script (and fudge about with postgresql)
as a recent update broke it on our desktop, and our laptop may need to make the same adjustment.

install rtorrent

doas pacman -S rtorrent

cp /usr/share/doc/rtorrent/rtorrent.rc ~/.rtorrent.rc

unccoment:
#directory.default.set = ./

and rewrite it as:
directory.default.set = ./Downloads

uncomment:
#session.path.set = ./session

and:
mkdir ~/session

uncomment:
#schedule2 = watch_directory,5,5,load.start=./watch/*.torrent
and:
mkdir ~/watch

Whenever you download a torrent (from a browser)
move it from your ~/Downloads folder to your ~/watch

Then simply start
rtorrent

And it will look to watch and session to start/resume torrents

Once done, look in your ~/Downloads folder and it should be finished.
