add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

SOLVED:Currently troubleshooting fail2ban to work with this, but due to no systemd, fail2ban needs further configuration that I have yet to figure out

ANSWER: In /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf, comment out the line that says 'polling' under the search for 'backend'

This will allow for logging to be done with a native logger instead of it searching for systemd's journald by default.

Then create a file called /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.local and input the following:
[sshd]
enabled   = true
filter    = sshd
banaction = ufw
backend   = polling
maxretry  = 3
findtime  = 1d
bantime   = 1d
ignoreip  = 127.0.0.1/8

In /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Change LogLevel to VERBOSE

restart the fail2ban service and test it with:

doas fai2ban -client status

install paxtest

doas pacman -S paxtest

install firejail

doas pacman -S firejail

doas firecfg

doas apparmor_parser -r /etc/appamor.d/firejail-default

doas mv someapp someapp_disabled (will break the link, simply name it back to its original to reenable it) rtorrent, newsboat, mpv, librewolf, chromium, links, steam, steam-runtime

also comment out in /etc/firejail/steam* all rules

cd /etc/firejail
