Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

Set up to no longer use a display manager, instead we will rely on the startx script:

cp the .xinitrc .bash_profile and .zprofile files here to /home/brian directory

To test, simply create a down file in your /etc/runit/sv/lightdm directory:

doas touch down

doas chmod +x down

Then turn off your lightdm service:

doas sv down lightdm

This will drop you into tty7, from there simply reboot.

Now you should be able to log in just using the tty1 it drops you into.

If all went well, you should be back in your i3 graphical user interface. Check to make sure all services are still running, and then delete unnecessary packages.

doas pacman -Rs lightdm lightdm-runit gnome-keyring (it will complain a couple times, just uninstall whatever else it complains about)

Then update your mlocate database:

updatedb

After it updates, you'll want to delete any remaining packages

locate lightdm | grep -v timeshift | grep -v icon | doas xargs -d\\n rm -r -v

Afterwards which you'll want to redo timeshift to be extra clean:

doas timeshift --delete (select 0)

doas timeshift --create

And updatedb again.
