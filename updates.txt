Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

Install bspwm and sxhkd and xdo and viewnior and wavemon and newsboat

Update thinkorswim

go to
https://www.tdameritrade.com/tools-and-platforms/thinkorswim/desktop/download.html

And at the bottom you will notice new Linux instructions for installation. In your downloads folder use wget to install the program.

wget "https://mediaserver.thinkorswim.com/installer/InstFiles/thinkorswim.zip"

unzip the file

unzip thinkorswim.zip

This requires Java 11 or higher, so uncomment the pacman.conf IgnorePkg section for openjdk and update it using paru.

paru

Then from your Downloads folder, chmod +x the launcher.jar file so it can be executed.

copy the entirety of the thinkorswim folder to /home/brian/thinkorswim

cp -r Downloads /home/brian/thinkorswim

I have already aliased the program to thinkorswim in our aliases, but in case you need to test it, you MUST be inside the thinkorswim folder, from there you can use the java command to execute the launcher.jar as such:

java -jar launcher.jar
