add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:

add notation about tr (translate command):

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
