Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

Look up the select command (online, man page is not as helpful). It makes a nice simple selectio menu for your users in bash

Install expac

doas pacman -S expac

Install pkgtop

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SharUpOff/pkgtop/main/dist/pkgtop.sh -so - | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/pkgtop > /dev/null

sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pkgtop

Finally figured out how to get language servers working neovim, you have to npm install -g each of them from ~/.local/nvim/share/lsp-servers (note that there is still work to be done here...)

After updating your nvim, make sure to run :LspInstallerInfo and update your language servers

***Install fail2ban

doas pacman -S fail2ban fail2ban-runit

doas ln -s /etc/runit/sv/fail2ban /run/runit/service/

doas cp ~/Documents/notes/jail.local /etc/fail2ban/

doas sv start fail2ban

## copy into short walkthrough:

***Set up apparmor (basic security measure)

doas pacman -S apparmor apparmor-runit audit audit-runit python-notify2 python-psutil

doas ln -s /etc/runit/sv/auditd /run/runit/service/

doas sv start auditd

Create an audit group, add $USER to it, and add audit group to /etc/audit/auditd.conf:

doas groupadd -r audit
doas gpasswd -a $USER audit

/etc/audit/auditd.conf

log_group = audit

In /etc/rc/apparmor.conf, uncomment enforce mode

In /etc/default/grub, rewrite the line at CMDLINE as such (be exact and careful here):

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,apparmor,bpf net.ifnames=0"

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

reboot

If all went well run aa-enabled, which should yield "Yes"

aa-enabled

Now load simple defaults:

doas apparmor_parser /usr/share/apparmor/extra-profiles/

And reboot again, you should have some sane security defaults now.
