Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

Install bash-completion

doas pacman -S bash-completion

copy bashrc.txt and inputrc.txt to home directory

cp bashrc.txt ~/.bashrc && cp inputrc.txt ~/.inputrc

This will now allow completion in bash using the tab button (a bit faster than zsh since zsh-autocompletion tries to predict what you type)

Install yank ( more feature filled version of xclip/xsel)

paru yank (choose 1st option)

cp aliases ~/.aliases
