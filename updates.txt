Use this file as a post-it for packages to install on laptop/desktop.

add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

Install picom (better than xcompmgr, no screen tearing)

doas pacman -S picom

Copy i3 and picom configs

cp -r ~/Documents/notes/picom ~/.config/

cp ~/Documents/notes/i3/config ~/.config/i3/

restart i3 to be sure

If it works, uninstall xcompmgr
