add notation about awk as
Select everything but the second field:
awk '!($2="")'

add notation about tr (translate command):
replace every newline with a single space: tr '\n' ' '

add notation about using find to list only files in current directory and NOT subdirectory:
find $dir -maxdepth 1 -type f

add notation about using pick to parse through output, and pipe that using xargs to another command:
example:
ls | pick | xargs bat # will give you a choice of the files from ls, pick displays a menu to "pick" the file, which then is parsed to xargs bat (invokes bat on choice from ls | pick)

Look up the select command (online, man page is not as helpful). It makes a nice simple selectio menu for your users in bash

Finally figured out how to get language servers working neovim, you have to npm install -g each of them from ~/.local/nvim/share/lsp-servers (note that there is still work to be done here...)
