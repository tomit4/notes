ctags is a great little tool that allows you to traverse large code bases to see outside files that define variables/funcitons that are imported into our C programs.

(install the ctags program)

within our project with multiple .h and .c files, invoke ctags:

ctags

Which will create a txt file called tags

This will be referenced when we need to use it in the project. From our text editor we can then invoke CTRL+} or CTRL+] to invoke ctags, which will then take us to the file and the line where that variable was first created (extremely useful!).

We also can to the same in nvim by:

:ta some_variable

And it will do the same, searching for the file and line where some_variable was defined.
