KeePassXC is a password generator and password database that is password
protected.

There are many tutorials on how to use the GUI version of keepassxc. These notes
are solely to briefly document some basics of the keepassxc-cli:

Navigate to the directory where you have your .kdbx file, and invoke
keepassxc-cli with the 'open' option on it:

```
keepassxc-cli open mypasswords.kdbx
```

Once you have entered your super secret lengthy and complex password
You will be presented with a prompt like so:

```
passwords>
```

The 'help' command does what you'd expect. If you need to know more about a
specific option printed out by the help command you can append that option to
the help command to get more information:

```
help show
```

You can list out the contents of the database like so:
ls

You cannot navigate into subdirectories of the database using something like
'cd', but you can show the contents of the specific password contents by using
the show command. If the subdirectory has spaces in it, you'll need to escape
them using the backslash character '\'.

```
show mydir/This\ Is\ My \Entry
```

This will display the data except for the password itself. To display the
password you can use the -s flag to show:

```
show -s mydir/This\ Is\ My \Entry
```

The cli tool is more powerful than this, and at the time of this writing, I have
done all my interactions with keepassxc through the GUI, but will append to
these notations as I learn more about the CLI in the future.
