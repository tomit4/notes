profanity is an XMPP TUI client inspired by irssi.

Using it is pretty simple, just invoke it from the command line:

profanity

You will be dropped into an irssi like environment. You can log in using your JID:

/connect username@federated_server.org

It will then prompt you for your password.

You can make this more straight forward by setting up an account:

/help account

To message someone specifically use:

/msg their_name

To join a room, type:

/join chatroom

To leave a room, type:

/close

To navigate rooms/screens, type:

/win 2 (or any number for rooms)

To chat, simply type into the prompt. If you have a long msg to write, use the editor:

/editor

To bookmark a room, add it, if you want to join upon login immediately:

/bookmark add room@example.com nick YOURNICK
/bookmark join room@example.com

You can scroll up the chat using pgUp and pgDown keys.

There's a lot more to this client, but that's the basics, for more, visit the official page or simply type:

/help
