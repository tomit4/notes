# WGU Questionnaire for Potential Student Recruiter

- Can I start any time? (i.e. there are no set semesters) Terms starting 1st of
  every month (about 1 month.)

- How do transfer credits work with sophia.org and study.com ?
  https://partners.wgu.edu/home (check every month for updates) have transfer
  credits in by the 5th of the month before enrollment (make sure to apply
  beforehand, it's free, no obligations).

- I have a bachelors, how can I transfer credits from LMU, Art Center? How long
  does it take for me to find out which credits can transfer? When filling out
  the application, there will be a place for you to request transcripts (mark
  that you want WGU to attempt to grab transcripts). Can take up to 14 days(can
  only be requested during application)

  Parchment.com if it doesn't work initially can retrieve transcripts and they
  have a partnership with WGU.. can take within 2 to 3 days (5 to have in
  account).

- Is there any facilitation in place for internships while I am enrolled? Don't
  offer direct internships (WGU handshake is a network for potential employers).
  Alumni services does offer events (notified via email).

- What is your tuition refund policy? Specifically in regards to timing. Flat
  rate tuition (6 months of access to the courses, price is same). Can sign up
  for as many courses as you want (accelerated if desired). Check in with
  financial services. If you complete your final term before 6 months, it is
  possible to get reimbursement based off of how much time is left, but check
  with Financial services to be sure.

- What is your graduation rate?
  - Updating April 1st for Computer Science.
