# Taken from Mastering Linux Shell Scripting book (pg. 61),
# this simple table shows possible flags to use in the test command
# we have already used this in certain runit init scripts,
# for example testing if a directory exists in our postgresql scripts:

if [ ! -d "/var/run/postgresql" ]; then
	echo "creating directory /var/run/postgresql"

	mkdir -p "/var/run/postgresql"
	chown -R postgres:postgres "/var/run/postgresql"
fi

# An example of an abbreviated version of this,
# however, shows that the if statement is not necessary:

[ -h /usr/src/linux ] &&rm /usr/src/linux

The above tests if the file /usr/src/linux is a symbolic link, and if it returns true, then removes that link

Other flags include the following:

    -d                   This shows that it's a directory
    -e                   This shows that the file exists in any form
    -x                   This shows that the file is executable
    -f                   This shows that the file is a regular file
    -r                   This shows that the file is readable
    -p                   This shows that the file is a named pipe
    -b                   This shows taht the file is a block device
file1 -nt file2          This checks if file1 is newer than file2
file1 -ot file2          This checks if file1 is older than file2
-O file                  This checks if the logged-in user is the owner of the file
    -c                   This shows that the file is a character device
