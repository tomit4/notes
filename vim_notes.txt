# Running Bash Commands from within Vim:

:! <bash command>

# Dealing with multiple files:

#Tabs:

Open a new tab:
:tabe <optional filename>

You can cycle through tabs using:
gt or gT

To open up a new vertical window:

:vert new filename.txt

Or another way to open a vertical window:

Ctrl + w + v

You can cycle through windows using:
Ctrl + ww

# From NerdTree you can also simply push t to open a new tab of the file you have selected
t

# Also from NerdTree you can simply push s to open a new window of the file you have selected
s


Side Note: in NerdTree you can display hidden files by invoking capital I:
I

# You can open multiple files by simply typing them in sequentially after the vim command(tab auto complete works on this):

vim item1.txt item2.txt

# You can hope between files then with the following commands(not as effective as tabs):
# Next
:n
# Previous
:N or :prev

# To see which files are open in the vim buffer:
:args

# To open up more, simply type:

:n item3.txt

# Note that this would only open item3.txt, it clears the buffer when you do this and so you would have to enter your total list of files.

# Open up NeoTerm:

# I have set up a custom keybind for opening up a small horizontal window into which you can run neoterm

Ctrl -s |T <command>

# If you close the window with neoterm running, you cannot simply type :T <command> and start again, instead:

:Ttoggle

Will open it again, then you can start typing :T <command>
