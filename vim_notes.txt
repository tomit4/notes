# Global Search and Replace:

# Running Bash Commands from within Vim:

:! <bash command>

# Dealing with multiple files:

# You can open multiple files by simply typing them in sequentially after the vim command(tab auto complete works on this):

vim item1.txt item2.txt

# You can hope between files then with the following commands:

# Next
:n
# Previous
:N or :prev

# To see which files are open in the vim buffer:
:args

# To open up more, simply type:

:n item3.txt

# Note that this would only open item3.txt, it clears the buffer when you do this and so you would have to enter your total list of files.
